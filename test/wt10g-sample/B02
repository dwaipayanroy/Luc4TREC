<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When Advanced Installation is chosen for the installation of Warp, FDISK
thinks that <code>"your partition mapping may be corrupt"</code>. Partitions 
can only be deleted but this won't help. As a result, you can only
use Easy Installation and choose the default partition. This may not be what
you want.
<p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
Any
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Partitions on your harddisk (for example Linux' ext2fs) may be misaligned so that
it confuses FDISK. This is probably a bug in Warp.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
The FDISK included with OS/2 2.1 (or Warp Beta II) does not have this problem. If you
can't get this FDISK, contact me.
<p>
There are at least four possible solutions to this problem.
<p>
<OL>
<LI>If you have the floppy version of Warp, backup the disk containing FDISK
(<b>Diskette 1</b>). Copy the FDISK of 2.1 onto that disk, replacing Warp's 
FDISK.<p>
<LI>If you have the CD version of Warp, probably the easiest solution is to make
the diskimages from the CD. Execute MAKEDSKS.BAT or MAKEDSKS.CMD on your CD
for that. Then proceed as described above. If you're not an expert, this is the way to go.
The disadvantage is that you'll need lots of floppies, and installation will take quite some
time. <em>If I were you, I would not install all bells and whistles. Once you have a minimal Warp
system on your harddisk, you can install other parts directly from the CD. When Selective
Install asks for a path (defaults to A:), change that to <b>x:</b>\OS2IMAGE, where
<b>x:</b> is the drive letter of your CD-ROM.</em>
<p>
<LI>If you have the CD version, you could also temporarily copy all the installation files
to your harddisk, if you have the diskspace to spare (about 45 Mb). See <a HREF="cdinst.html">
these instructions</a> for more information on how to do that. Then copy the 2.1 FDISK
over the Warp FDISK (in <b>D:</b>\OS2IMAGE\DISK_1) and install from there. After the
installation, these files can be deleted.
<p>
<LI>
If you insist to do the installation from the CD, you don't have enough free diskspace and
you're an expert, you can also use the following approach. This one worked for me. It's quite
clumsy so if you know a better way, please contact me.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Get a good FDISK.COM from OS/2 2.1.
<LI>Make a diskcopy of Warp's <b>Diskette 1</b> and use that backup.
<LI>You'll have to make some room (about 250 Kb) on it to accomodate the
  good FDISK. For instance, if you don't have an Adaptec SCSI card, you
  might want to delete the AHA*.ADD drivers from that disk. If you don't want to
  see the (harmless) warnings during the boot process, you should delete the corresponding
  entries in CONFIG.SYS as well.
<LI>Copy SYSINST2.EXE from the CD to the floppy. Something like:
  <code>COPY <b>x:</b>\OS2IMAGE\DISK_1\SYSINST2.EXE A:</code>
<LI>Use a binary file editor or DEBUG.EXE on this SYSINST2.EXE to change FDISK.COM
(two references) to, say, FDORK.COM. (If you are not able to do this, you could ask me
to send you a copy).
<LI>Copy the good FDISK.COM to <b>Diskette 1</b> under the name FDORK.COM
<LI>Edit the CONFIG.SYS on <b>Diskette 1</b> so that the SET PATH line now reads:
<pre>
  SET PATH=A:\;\;\OS2;\OS2\SYSTEM;\OS2\INSTALL\etc.
           ^^^^ add this
</pre>
<LI>Now reboot and follow the normal installation procedure. When you get to
  the blue installation screen (<b>Diskette 1</b>) where you have to choose Easy or
  Advanced Installation, press F3 for the command line.
<LI><code>A:</code>
<LI>Execute <code>SYSINST2.EXE</code>. Now you get the blue installation screen again. 
Of course, choose Advanced Installation (since Easy Installation works OK).
<LI>Choose "Specify different drive/partition".
<LI>Now you should see the (good) FDISK being loaded from the floppy. (You get the standard
warning screen, "FDISK can be dangerous" etc.)
</UL>
</OL>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
In the end, I borrowed a SCSI tapestreamer, backed up my data and repartitioned
the whole disk. FDISK and my harddisk are buddies again...

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Absolutely! </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Well&#133;maybe. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Definitely not, at least for now. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">I know what you're thinking- 'hey I thought
this thing was going to provide answers to my questions'. The
reality is, contrary to popular belief, it's not for everyone.
Perhaps, in the future it will be, but for now, businesses should
do some careful planning and evaluating as with any new venture.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Don't get me wrong, most everyone can benefit
from an Internet presence, but many businesses
have been in such a rush that they have made many mistakes, wasted
a lot of money, and in some cases been taken for a long ride down an
expensive toll-road by some unscrupulous Net entrepreneurs in
the driver's seat.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This has taken place many times because people
have had the idea that all you need to do to make money on the
Internet is to put up a web site. You've heard it before, 'build
it and they will come'. That's like saying you just installed
toll free 800 line for customer orders and expect it to immediately
begin ringing with orders. Unless you let others know about it,
no one is going to call.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Therefore, with all the misconceptions regarding
how to use the Net, you may have heard some horror stories from
some companies that have already been on and off the Internet,
or are trapped in an untravelled web site somewhere because they
were duped into signing a long term contract. The Internet is
like everything else. You can't run before you learn to walk.
You can't walk before you learn to crawl. CyberDirections can
help you get you up and running in no time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Arial">Is it right for me?<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Here are some of the most common reasons  companies 
establish an Internet presence:<br>
<ul>
<li>Over 7 million World Wide Web Users (can't ignore that many prospects)
<li>Provide better service for your customers
<li>Distribute information quickly and efficiently
<li>Increase sales
<li>Ability to reach highly-desired demographic
<li>Stay in contact with sales force
<li>International business opportunities
<li>Reduce costs of traditional expenses (phone, fax, postal, etc...)
<li>Allow feedback from your customers</FONT>
</ul>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Sounds good doesn't it? Wait, not so fast. There are some 
things you should consider first.<br></FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">So, how do you determine if your business should
be on the Net? The following 4 basic steps should be given consideration
in determining if it is right for you:<BR>
</FONT>
<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#customers" >Identify your customers</A>
<LI><A HREF="#products" >Identify your products and services</A>
<LI><A HREF="#goals" >Determine your goals and objectives</A>
<LI><A HREF="#competition" >Check out your competition</A>
</OL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Let's examine these 4 steps in detail:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="customers"><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Identify Your Customers</FONT></B></A>
<BR>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Who do you sell to? Businesses? Consumers?
Government agencies? The answer to this question will help in
determining whether the Internet may be right for you. You must
consider your target market and where you will most likely find
them. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">For example, computer related products and
software are the best-selling items on the Internet. So, if your
business is in this market there is more reason to get online
versus if your area of expertise is Window Washing . It's not
to say that a window washing business cannot benefit from the
Internet, but where do you expect your customers and prospects
to be? Now if that same window washing company had a special offer
on cleaning computer monitors then maybe you've got something
there.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The development of a commercial web site is
something that needs planning and careful consideration in order
to have a successful project. Your site can help build your business,
even generate cash flow. Or it can be a total bust.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">To succeed , you must consider your target
audience and what would attract them to your site. Would you visitors
be drwn because of in-depth product information? Or discounts
on your products and services only available online?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As far as selling to consumers, surveys have
found that most users are young, well-educated males with above-average
incomes. However women are a rapidly growing group on the Internet.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">One reason for the above-average incomes is
directly related to the cost of getting online. However, with
connect rates and unlimited calling plans for $19.95 per month
and less, we can expect the average user demographic to widen
out a little bit. Especially as we see the Internet get easier
to use and navigate, and the ability to surf the web on our TV's.
We can be sure that more and more people will be dialing up. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="products"><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Identify Your Products
and Services<BR>
</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Spend any length of time reading about the
Internet and you will read of both successes and failures. As
more statistics become available, it will be easier to determine
the buying habits of web surfers, but right now that can be a
difficult task. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The University of Michigan Business School
surveyed 13,006 World Wide Web users, mostly from North America.
Their survey showed that the vast majority of users were just
&quot;browsing&quot; or looking for entertainment. The survey
showed that while 27% of respondents had bought software on the
Internet (the most popular item) the vast majority of respondents
used the web to get information rather than make purchases.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=-2 FACE="Arial">Results from Sunil Gupta of the HERMES
project at the Michigan Business School http://www.umich.edu/~sgupta/hermes.html
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a couple of ways to look at this.
With the tens of millions of Internet users out there (many who
have e-mail access only, but that's another discussion), if only
25 to 30 percent of them made purchases on line that is quite
a large customer base. On the other hand, just because they are
on the Internet doesn't mean they will see <I><B>your</B></I>
site. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">So, promotion of your web site is something
that is extremely important, and a topic that will be discussed
in CyberDirections.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The bottom line is, you must determine if Internet
users will be interested in your products and services, just as
you would in preparing a direct mail campaign in your local neighborhood.
In fact as we progress through CyberDirections you will see how
in many cases a successful web site will resemble a direct mail
campaign. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The web site has to provide more convenient
access to products and services.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="goals"><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Identify Business Goals
&amp; Objectives</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">As we already mentioned the Internet has plenty
of &quot;browsers&quot;, people just looking for information or
wanting to find something fun and entertaining. However the Internet
is incomparable in allowing someone to define and reach a niche
market. It is possible through effective on line techniques to
reach the exact people on the Internet who are looking for what
you have to offer, and how to do this will be explained in detail
later.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">However, before jumping on line you must determine
what your goals and objectives are. For example, what do you want
your web site to do for you? Increase sales? Create consumer awareness?
Provide up to date information for your field sales force? Or,
perhaps you are looking for ways to cut expenses by fully utilizing
the Internet.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Let me give you a couple of scenarios: </FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Scenario 1<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">ABC Company has a new Widget and wants to begin
marketing it directly to the consumer. They can accomplish this
in the traditional distribution channels (Manufacturer &gt;&gt;
Distributor &gt;&gt; Wholesaler &gt;&gt; Retailer) and add an
Internet site that serves as a retail location that is always
open. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">An individual can visit the site and learn
what the new Widget does, the problems it solves, the benefits
to the consumer, the warranty, cost, etc&#133; then they can order
online using secure commerce software right on the web site and
receive their very own Widget shipped right to their door.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Better yet, ABC Company could put a variety
of information dealing with the activities and interests of their
Widget users on the site to promote repeat visits, or a Web Bulletin
Board that would allow ABC customers to discuss the many uses
of the Widget and enable ABC to provide quick answers to customer
service situations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This way not only has ABC provided a way for
them to market the Widget to consumers, but through other bits
of &quot;information&quot; and/or &quot;entertainment&quot; ABC
is able to attract many people to their site besides just someone
who looked up Widgets in a search engine.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">This helps spread the word about ABC Company
and perhaps when one of their regular web site visitors ever needs
a Widget they will contact ABC.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Scenario 2<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">XYZ Company has two facilities, one on the
East Coast the other in the Southeast and a sales force in both
areas that work out in the field. How could the Internet work
for them?</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Well, they could apply the same strategies
as ABC did, however they can add to that the ability to cut some
of their business expenses through a well designed web site.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">For example, an XYZ Sales rep is at a prospects
business and needs to know if the company has enough Gizmos to
fulfill the large order she's working on. She can log on remotely
to the XYZ web site and get up to the minute pricing and quantity
info. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">XYZ can also use the Internet to cut down on
long distance communications, postal mail, and faxes by using
e-mail. They can also send out press releases to trade journals
and national publications via e-mail. On line response forms can
be used to provide customer support in addition to 800 numbers
to cut down on 800 number fees.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">In this scenario, XYZ Company enjoys the benefits
of the latest technology, enables them to respond quicker to its
sales force and customers, and creates savings on traditional
business expenses at the same time. These savings can help offset
some of the cost of the Internet connection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">And the best part is, you don't have to be
a big company to realize the benefits mentioned in both scenarios.
In fact, the Internet really enables a smaller company, or even
a home-based business to operate on a level playing field. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Ask yourself, how much could you save in phone
bills and postage by utilizing the Internet? How much faster would
you be able to respond to customer questions or problems? How
many more sales would you be able to make? Or, how many new prospects
would you contact through an interactive web site?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="competition"><B><FONT FACE="Arial">Check Out Your Competition
<BR>
</FONT></B></A>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Some companies have been so successful on the
Internet they have closed multiple retail locations to conduct
business strictly on the Internet. Others provide an entire catalog
on line and then complete the sale through an 800 number order
center. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">So, where do you fit in? Well, assuming you
are not the only one in your particular business or profession,
what is your competition doing?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Let's say you run a business that sells Hollywood
memorabilia. You've got some hard to find pictures of James Dean
and Marilyn Monroe. Maybe you just purchased one of Elvis' stage
costumes at an auction, and you've even got one of those Darth
Vader Light Saber things. Do you think the Internet would help
you increase your business? Well, take a click over to Yahoo
and run a search on Movies, Memorabilia, Collectibles, or Star
Wars and you will find some links that correspond to your business.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">When you find a competitor, check out their
site. Examine how they conduct business online, if they do. How
do their products compare to yours? What do you like or dislike
about their site? Are you aware of their methods of promotion?
Then, keep checking back on it for a couple
of weeks. If you find it is a busy web site or they are adding
more compelling content or updated features, that could be a good
sign. Perhaps it's time to get your web site up &amp; running,
so you can get your share of visitors, maybe you'll find someone
who is willing to pay top dollar for that Light Saber you have.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Also, spend some time just browsing yourself.
You might be able to find something that you would like to apply
to your web site. It's also a good way to spend time at work surfing
the web &amp; call it &quot;Marketing Research&quot;.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">These four basic steps will help you in determining
if the Internet is suitable for your business. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Once you determine you want a web site, many
times the first question is, what will it cost? And that depends.
There are effective web presentations that range from free to
tens of thousands of dollars. But realistically, most companies
can get what they want on the Internet for the cost of letterhead
and new brochures.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">What should you do to get started? How much
will it cost? These subjects as well as a segment about getting
on the Internet without getting taken for a ride, will be discussed

<hr>

Jon,
<p>
Due to non-video related problems I was forced to re-install Warp, and
consequently had to bring myself up to date on the installation of video
drivers for the Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM.  Although I managed to get
things working, the Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM (and apparently DRAM)
situation re OS/2 is NOT a pretty picture!
<p>
I am very grateful to <a href="mailto:G.DRAYTON@mang.canterbury.ac.nz">Glenn Drayton-Bright</a>
for his posting on The Warp Pharmacy titled 
<a href="Stealth64.html">"Using Diamond Stealth 64 with Warp Fullpack/Warp Connect"</a>
He describes two main problems, and it turns out that one of those two
problems is also true for the Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM drivers
installation for "Warp without Windows Included" (or whatever it's
called).  The installation for the VRAM card also patches the OS/2
kernel and then "updates" the system patch level from 3.0 to 2.1.  I had
discovered that my previous Warp 3.0 installation had somehow gotten
changed to a 2.1 syslevel, but did not know how that had come about; now
I know!  In defense of Diamond Multi-Media, they do not claim that the
drivers are for Warp:  only for OS/2 2.1.  It is possible to make them
work with Warp, however, with certain limitations.
<p>
They work perfectly for me in 640x480x256, 800x600x256, 1280x1024x256,
640x480x65536, and 800x600x65536.  They do NOT work for me at the
selectable resolutions of 1024x768x256, 1024x768x65536, or 1152x864x256;
with those choices it boots up to a black screen, although that was not
the case with OS/2 2.1.  Perhaps that is why IBM included the drivers
with 2.1, but not with Warp.  That probably also explains why they seem
to work for some people but not for others.  I had been using
1280x1024x256 for months without realizing that I would get a black
screen if I attempted certain other resolutions.
<p>
You may remember that the original posting for 
<a href="Stealth.html">"Using Diamond Stealth 64
with Warp"</a> listed an ftp source for 964os1.zip and 964os2.zip, but 
that those files later disappeared from that site.  You then updated the
driver location to 964gxe.zip on hobbes.nmsu.edu.  In preparation for my
new installation I retrieved 964gxe.zip, but discovered that the
included drivers were for various #9 brand S3 video cards.  I don't know
if they would have worked with my Diamond card or not, but since the
instructions were for various models of #9 cards, and I didn't know
which of them would be similar to my Diamond card, I went to
<a href="ftp://ftp.diamondmm.com/">ftp.diamondmm.com</a> and retrieved 
9OS2_A.EXE and 9OS2_B.EXE from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.diamondmm.com/pub/drivers/stl64.vrm">/pub/drivers/stl64.vrm</a>
directory. The included 9OS2_B.NFO file says:

</pre>
<p>
Diamond's updated Readme.S3 file contains some important information,
including the notice that a "pre-defined monitor" must be selected when
running their S64MODE.EXE because "Custom does not work properly under
OS/2."  In fact, their updated S64MODE.EXE does not even contain a
"Custom" choice.
<p>
I followed Mr.  Drayton-Bright's suggestion to edit the S3INST.CMD file
to comment out the offending lines before running the installation, and
also made the changes that were previously posted under "Using Diamond
Stealth 64 with Warp," and which were originally provided to my by
Jayant Murthy.  (The modified S3INST.CMD, with both sets of changes
incorporated, is attached.)  I then installed the drivers to my new Warp
installation, and took copious notes as I did so.  The results of my
experience follow, with the following caveats:
<p>
<ol>
<li>This is for the Diamond Stealth 64 VRAM only:  not the DRAM, and
not the Video VRAM.  	Feedback tells me that it works for either 2 meg
or 4 meg of VRAM, and either VL or PCI.
<li>This is for OS/2 Warp for Windows:  not Warp "fullpack," and not
Warp Connect. See also <a href="Stealth64.html">Using Diamond Stealth 64 
with Warp Fullpack/Warp Connect"</a> on the Warp Pharmacy.
<li>I could not make it work at 1024x768x256, 1024x768x65536, or
1152x864x256, although those resolutions worked for me with Warp 2.1
and the same drivers.
<li>Everything works fine for me in 640x480x256, 800x600x256,
1280x1024x256, 640x480x65536, and 800x600x65536. This includes OS/2,
DOS, and Windows applications, fullscreen or windowed.
<li>Your mileage may vary.
</ol>

Step by step instructions follow:
<p>
<ol>
<li>ftp the files 9OS2_A.EXE and 9OS2_B.EXE from the 
/pub/drivers/stl64.vrm directory at ftp.diamondmm.com. 
<li>Unzip each file to its own 1.44 floppy, and use the LABEL
command to label the floppies S3 DRV1 and S3 DRV2.
<li>Run the S64MODE.exe command (which is on floppy #1),
without parameters. Be sure to follow the instructions in 
Diamond's README.S3 to select a predefined monitor. I use an
IBM 17P, which is not one of the choices, so I selected NEC 5FG. 
<li>Edit the s3inst.cmd (which is on both floppies) to make 
it like the attached s3inst.cmd. This involves remarking out
several lines, changing some references to \os2 to read 
\os2\boot, and correcting some typos in the original file. 
<li>From within the os2 directory, execute the command:
<pre>
   attrib /s -r -s -h screen0*.sys 
</pre>
<li>Run the modified s3inst.cmd from floppy #1. Syntax is 
S3inst a: d: (where d is the os/2 boot drive). 
<li>Reboot when prompted to do so.
<li>Open OS/2 System, System Setup, Selective Install
 (NOT Device Driver Install as readme.s3 says).
<li>At the selective install menu, click on Primary display,
 scroll to the top of the selections, and select 32 Bit S3 
 Display Drivers v2.4.
<li>Click on OK.
<li>At the next screen, click on OK again.
<li>At next screen, click on Install.
<li>Put the disk labeled S3 DRV1 in drive A:
<li>The next screen (for me) offers I:\os2image as default.
 Change that to read A:\ and click on install.
<li>Select "Install using Display Adapter Utility Program." 
(Per revised README.S3 instructions). 
<li>When prompted for location of utility, type in:
"a:\s64mode.exe monitor" (without the quotes). Yes, the
..exe is necessary. 
<li> When prompted to "Insert the diskette with the following
 label into Drive A: "S3 Display Driver Diskette 2",
 insert the diskette that you previously labelled S3 DRV2,
 and click on OK.
<li>Insert MS Windows diskettes as prompted. This was
1, 5, and 6 for me.
<li>Reboot when prompted to do so.
<li>Open OS/2 System, System Setup, System, and select
the Screen page of the settings notebook. You should now
have a number of choices for screen resolution. For me, 
640x480x256, 800x600x256, 1280x1024x256, 640x480x65536,
and 800x600x65536 work fine. I could not make it work at 
1024x768x256, 1024x768x65536, or 1152x864x256.
<li>Select desired resolution, close notebook, and reboot. 
I like 1280x1024x256 or 800x600x65536.

Chandler Howell (<a href="mailto:chandler@naftalab.bus.utexas.edu">chandler@naftalab.bus.utexas.edu</a>) writes (6th August, 1995):
<p>
Having a machine with an Stealth64 VRAM, and having had its syslevel 
changed by S3INST.CMD (and not realizing what had done it until reading 
this page, only that any attempt to install the Base OS CSD's would die 
horribly), I decided that, if the only solution was to re-install the 
OS, "risky" recovery methods could first be attempted &lt;gr&gt;.
<p>
Using TEDIT.EXE (from the DevCon 6 CD (#2, I think)), which handles both 
binary and text files, I edited C:\OS2\INSTALL\SYSLEVEL.OS2 and changed 
the SYSLEVEL from the 2.1 SysLevel back to WR03000 and saved it again.  
This completely fixed the SysLevel problem in 2 minutes, as opposed to a 
lengthy and frustrating re-install.
<p>
<b>Note:</b>Don't do this edit with the standard TEDIT.EXE supplied with Warp - you
will corrupt the file. If you need a binary editor, try: 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.4/os2/editors/hexedit2.zip">HexEdit/2</a>

<h3>...and some reviews</h3>
<p>
Ned Reiter (<a href="mailto:nreiter@execpc.com">nreiter@execpc.com</a>) writes (25th July, 1995): <p>
Partition Magic (PM) is one OS/2 product that works just as advertised.
I have used it on my SCSI drives in my tower system and on my notebook
(Midwest Micro Soundbook w/520MB HD).  In the case of the Soundbook, PM
wouldn't run, it gave an error about the partition table.  When I called
tech support, I was given the name of the hidden file to download which
had the latest version (1.02 at the time).  However, that version still
gave an error and wouldn't let me access the partition table.  FDISK saw
the partitions, but showed an extra 10MB of unused space, which couldn't
be, since the drive was formatted as one partition from Midwest Micro.
I had OS/2 installed as dual boot.  Eventually, the system failed and
refused to boot.  The BIOS setup auto configure for the HD didn't seem
right, so I manually configured the drive with parameters that Midwest
Micro tech support had given me last year.  I installed OS/2 and
partitioned the disk into two drives.  When I installed PM, it saw the
partitions correctly.  
<p>
I have since changed partition sizes on my SCSI drive and set up a new,
unformatted partition (in anticipation of Warp Connect) with no
problems.  It only took about an hour to resize a ~770MB partition and
move it up to make room for the new partition.
<p>
I can recommend this program without reservation.  The tech support is
excellent, updates are available from their BBS as well as on the 
<a href="http://www.powerquest.com/">Web</a>.
<hr>
Chandler Howell (<a href="mailto:chandler@naftalab.bus.utexas.edu">chandler@naftalab.bus.utexas.edu</a>) writes (6th August, 1995): 
<p>
I originally purchased Partition Magic because of its much-vaunted 
abilities to transform FAT drive to HPFS, something I namely wanted to do 
to preserve the (very delicate) existing WARP installation, installed 
with Dual Boot on a new IBM ThinkPad so I could install the PMX server 
for TCP-IP 2.0.
<p>
While every other process the Partition Magic can perform is just 
point-and-click and pretty much idiot proof, the conversion of your boot 
partition is not.  Fortunately, however, the printed manual contained a 
keystroke-for-keystroke set of instructions that actually were 
keystroke-for-keystroke how to accomplish this process.  I started the 
conversion, went to lunch, and by the time I came back, a nearly-full 
540MB hard drive (in a notebook, no less) with over 400MB of data on it 
was converted without even a hiccup.
<p>
For my second installation (The license is for two machines!), I installed 
it on a machine with DOS/WIN FAT, OS/2 Warp HPFS, and Linux EXT2 
partitions, with at least one of each type on two different drives (this 
thing is partition city!)
<p>
I have successfully resized both the Primary, Logical (Including extended) 
paritions of both drives (FAT and HPFS only), as well as moving all types 
of partitions within the free space that the re-sizing generated, all 
without failure.
<p>
This is on a DEC Celebris XL5100 (P5-100Mhz; NCR 810 SCSI-2; 
Seagate ST31230N 1GB C: and a DEC RZ28 2GB D:)
<p>
While moving a partion can be a rather lengthy process (the program 
surface scans the disk for every move), it has proven to be every bit as 
robust as I had originally hoped, and I can say that I would recommend 
this product quite highly to anyone who has a plethora of partitions 
which they are trying to manage, or wants (or needs) to convert their 
OS/2 FAT system to HPFS.
<p>
I found the manual to be clear, well-illustrated, and well-written; the 
interface to be very informative and very intuitive; and performance, 
while a little slow (though as compared to what I can't say), was 
extremely robust.

<p>
I recently purchased this product and it indeed does everything it's 
touted to do.  I converted a FAT Partition to HPFS with Partition Magic 
in an unbelievably short time.  On top of doing all it's supposed to do, 
it's also quite easy to use.  
<p>
For hard drive maintenance, which I consider to be a chore, this product 
actually makes it palatable.

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
When a Logitech serial Mouseman (the new "ergonomic" model) is used,
Warp goes through long periods where it fails to recognise right
button action.  (Feelx, when installed, continues to recognise these
OK.)  None of the selective install mice drivers work any better.  Old
C7 and M-series mice work fine, and the Mouseman itself works fine
under DOS, Windows-under-DOS, DOS VDMs, and Win-OS/2.
<hr>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
Logitech serial Mouseman.
<hr>
<h3>Problem</h3>
Unknown.
<hr>
<h2>Fix</h2>
A workaround is to click the middle
mouse button in the (empty) desktop after starting OS/2.  This seems
to eliminate the problem (until the next time you start OS/2).  
<p>
<hr>
<img src="images/new.gif"> Lars Eriksen (<a href="mailto:hallstro@oslonett.no">hallstro@oslonett.no</a>) writes (19th July, 1995):
<p>
There is now a much better solution, pointed out to me by a person on the
OS/2 Hotline.  There exists a fix, a replacement <code>mouse.sys</code>, that
solves the problem.  The replacement is contained in a file called 
<code><a href="ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/drivers/mouse/l_ms_os2.zip">
l_ms_os2.zip</a></code> (click to download) which is available at the 
<a href="http://www.leo.org/archiv/os2">LEO OS/2 Archive</A>.  A 
<code>readme</code> file explains how to install it.
<p>
But I'm still waiting for a driver that supports the middle button (for
fast cut-and-paste, for example.)  Logitech readily admits it's their
responsibility to write one but made no promises (I called their support
line.)

The <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Corporation</A> has developed a scanning tool which removes and
protects against a virus-like macro that tampers with a Word user's Save As
command. While this macro does not harm any document content or system
operations, it behaves like a virus in the way it replicates and distributes
itself. </P>
<P>The scanning tool will ensure that customers are no longer inconvenienced by
the macro and are protected against any future exposure. Customers can download
the scanning tool from several on-line sites or send mail to <A HREF="mailto:wordinfo@microsoft.com"><CODE>wordinfo@microsoft.com</CODE></A>. The scanning tool can be downloaded from the following on-line services:</P>

3.1, Word 6.0.1 for the Macintosh&amp;reg;, Word 6.0 for Windows NT(TM) and Word
for Windows 95. This macro does not affect earlier versions of Word for Windows
or Word for the Macintosh. After you open a document containing the macro,
documents you save will contain copies of it. Once installed, the macro only
lets you save documents as templates. The macro does not otherwise affect the
contents of documents, but it will replicate and distribute itself through Word
documents. </P>
<P><B>Q: How do I know whether or not I have been affected?</B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>The first time you open a document containing the macro you will
see a dialog box that only contains the number `1' and an `OK' button. You can
also verify whether or not the macro is installed by selecting the `Macro'
command from the &quot;Tools&quot; menu -- if the list contains the following
macros: <B>AAAZAO</B> and <B>AAAZFS</B> it has been installed.</P>
<P><I>[Editors note: The presence of macros with these names suggests the
presence of the effects of the Prank Macro, although it is possible that
legitimate macros with such unlikely names are present. Modified versions of the
Frank Macro might use entirely different names. --had]</I></P>  
<P><B>Q: How serious is the prank macro and what is the worst thing that could
happen? </B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>The macro does not cause data loss or any other serious system
corruption, but is an annoyance. However, if your system is affected, the File
Save As command in Word will cause your documents to be saved as templates These
templates will contain the macro.</P>
<P><B>Q: How do I get rid of the this macro? </B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>Microsoft has developed a scanning tool that will scan all of
your documents and remove the macro. It will also prevent re-installation of the
macro. The scanning tool can be downloaded from the following on-line services:</P> 
<UL>
<LI>The Microsoft World Wide Web site at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/"><CODE>http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/</CODE></A>
<LI>MSN(tm), The Microsoft Network using <B>go word: wordprankfix</B>
<LI>The Word forums on other on-line services such as CompuServe and America Online.
<LI>Customers can also get the tool by calling <I>Microsoft's Product
Support Services</I> at <B>206-462-9673</B> for <I>Word for Windows</I>, and
<B>206-635-7200</B> for <I>Word for the Macintosh</I>.
</UL>
<P><B>Q: Can I prevent getting this macro? </B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>There are two methods to prevent getting the prank macro. You can
install the scanning tool and it will prevent you from getting the macro in the
future. You can also disable the mechanism that allows the macro to install
itself by holding down the shift key when opening a template or document.</P>
<P><I>[Editors note: While the &quot;scanning tool&quot; provides protection
from some forms of the &quot;prank virus,&quot; it does not address the general
security problem. --had]</I></P>
<P><B>Q: Will a box of Word or Office that I buy in the store contain it? </B></P>
<P><B>A: </B>The prank macro does not exist in any version of Word or Office
that you would buy in a store. You can only get the it by opening a Word
document or template that already contains the macro. </P>
<P><B>Q. Can this macro be transferred with documents created with or being
read by Internet Assistant?</B></P>
<P>A. By design, Internet Assistant and documents created or read by it cannot
be affected. Internet Assistant, by design, blocks the mechanism that
distributes this type of macro. </P>
<P><B>Q. Can this macro be transferred with documents created with or being
read by WordMail? </B></P>
<P><B>A.</B> By design, Word cannot send or receive this type of macro in
WordMail messages.</P>
<P><B>Q. Can this macro be transferred by documents being read with the Word
Viewer?</B></P>
<P><B>A.</B> By design, the Microsoft Word Viewer cannot be affected by this
type of macro</P>
<P>You can download the <B>Scan831.doc</B> scanning tool from the Microsoft
World Wide Web Site at: <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice//msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/misc/scan831.doc"><CODE>http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice//msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/misc/scan831.doc</CODE></A>. 
Note: if you are using a browser that opens Word documents for viewing,
the scanning tool will run automatically.</P>

<h1>Welcome to the Office for Liaison with International Financial Institutions</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>

The Office of Liaison with International Financial Institutions (OLIFI), located at the           Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., assists Canadian firms and private sector       organizations in their pursuit of business opportunities financed by the two Washington-based International Financial Institutions (IFIs): <a href = "http://www.worldbank.org"> the World Bank</a> and <a href = "http://www.iadb.org">the Inter-American Development Bank</a>.  Each year, OLIFI responds to thousands of enquiries, of both a general and specific nature.<p>

Before contacting OLIFI, Canadian exporters interested in targeting markets generated by IFI lending should approach the IFI coordinator in one of Canada's International        Trade Centres (ITCs).  ITCs, located across the country, help new and experienced         Canadian exporters take advantage of export markets.  ITC officers perform a wide range of trade-related services, and provide market information and intelligence, one-on-one export counselling, and a link with the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service abroad, including OLIFI.<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

With any account  (except CyberCard), we can provide a <B>Virtual Domain</B>
for your Web site.  This provides access to your site through a unique
domain name.  We provide only <I>true</I> <B>Virtual Domain</B> service; not
any of the rip-off varieties some of our competitors are offering (you can
spot these by looking for URLs such as <TT>http://www.domain.com/domain/</TT>
or <TT>http://www.domain.com:8001/</TT>).
<P>
The <B>Virtual Domain</B> option also includes these free capabilities:
<UL>
<LI> All mail addressed to your domain, regardless of the username, will
     come to your account's mailbox.  This means that you can use
     <TT>webmaster@domain.com</TT>, <TT>info@domain.com</TT>,
     <TT>sales@domain.com</TT>, and whatever else you like, without having
     to worry about extra charges or conflicts with other accounts on the
     system.  If you want separate POP mailboxes for such addresses to be
     delivered to (for separate retrieval with a unique password), the
     charge is <I>$1/month</I> for each mailbox.
<LI> Mailing lists may be run (using <B>SmartList</B>) with your domain
     name as their delivery address.  For example, you can manage a mailing
     list named <TT>announce-list@domain.com</TT>.
<LI> <B>Virtual FTP</B>, which allows access to your files at
     <TT>ftp://ftp.domain.com/</TT>, will be enabled at your request, at no
     extra charge.
</UL>

Note that for new domains under the authority of InterNIC
(.com</TT> and .org</TT> are the most commonly used),
you will be billed separately for $100 maintenance by InterNIC.
They levy this charge to
cover the first two years of root nameservice and administration of your
domain at their level.  The $25 charge is payable to us for administering
your account and allocating an IP address.  The monthly charge is added on
to your regular account fee.  Please <I>do not</I> send us the InterNIC
fee - we will send it back to you if you do.  It is in your best interest to
let InterNIC bill you at their leisure.
<P>
We can also transfer existing domains to be used as <B>Virtual
Domains</B>, in which case the $100 InterNIC fee does not apply.  
<P>
You may search for available domains by using
<A HREF="http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois">WHOIS</A> at InterNIC.
<P>
<I>Note: InterNIC will bill you $50/year after the first two years.</I>

</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>$0.30/Mb/month</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If your site will need more disk space than the defaults allowed with our
accounts, you can avoid fees for overusage by prepaying at a lower rate.
The lower rate is <I>$0.30/Mb</I>.  Please specify the disk space you require
when using the <A HREF="index3.html">online signup system</A>, and we will
adjust your account and rates accordingly.

Additional Bandwidth
</H3></A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>$2/10Mb/day/month</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you find that your site is immensely popular and will consistently be
generating traffic beyond the defaults allowed with our accounts, you are
required to prepurchase a higher traffic allowance.  The prepurchase rate
is <I>$3/10Mb/day/month</I>.  What this means is best shown with an
example: In order to adjust
an account from its normal allowance of 100Mb/day to an
allowance of 150Mb/day average, the additional monthly fee is <I>$15</I>
(five units of 10Mb/day each).
<P>
Please specify the additional bandwidth you require
when using the <A HREF="/order_frame.html">online signup system</A>, and we will
adjust your account and rates accordingly.  Alternatively, you may wish to
judge your bandwidth requirements once you get
your site running.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<pre>
"x:\MMOS2\SBD2.SYS has not been installed. Line yy is ignored"
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
Sound Blaster 2.0 clones, including the MediaVision ThunderBoard and
other cards using the Thunder chipset.
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
The SBD2.SYS driver is made by Creative Labs. It contains a security check 
so that only genuine Sound Blasters can be used.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
The security check is to be removed. For OS/2 2.1, write the following text
to the file <code>patchsb2.fil</code> on your boot partition:
<pre>
FILE \mmos2\sbd2.sys
VER 3ed8 ab
CHA 3ed8 00
</pre>
<p>
For OS/2 Warp with or without WinOS2 (Red box or Blue box) use the
following text:
<pre>
FILE \mmos2\sbd2.sys
VER 42fc a5
CHA 42fc 00
</pre>
<p>
If you have downloaded the <a HREF="ftp://ftp.creaf.com/pub/creative/files/os2/sb_os2.exe>
latest driver</a>, v2.14, from the <a HREF="ftp://ftp.creaf.com/>Creative Labs FTP site</a>,
write the following text to the file <code>patchsb2.fil</code>:
<pre>
FILE \mmos2\sbd2.sys
VER 44fd e970ff
CHA 44fd 909090
</pre>
<p>
I'm not sure what driver is included with Warp Connect. Try any of the two
Warp patches above. Please contact me if you have Warp Connect.
<p>
Now open up an OS/2 Window and execute the following on the OS/2 command line:
<pre>
patch patchsb2.fil /a
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
This patch won't work for every Sound Blaster 2.0 clone, unfortunately.
Guaranteed to work with the Thunder chipset though.

<p>
<h3>What We Do for <a name="Canadian">Canadian</a> Companies</h3>

The Trade and Investment Development Section of the International Business Development Group promotes the export of Canadian goods and services to the mid-Atlantic States Region of the USA, namely, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and the Distri

ct of Columbia.  the mid-Atlantic consists of three major markets:  the Delaware Valley (Philadelphia-Wilmington), the Baltimore-Washington Corridor, and the State of Virginia.  The region is home to some of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas of the 
<p>

Canadian exports to this market exceeded Cdn. $9 billion in 1994, up over 20% from the previous year.  Increases are strong in the automobile industry, forestry products, agri-food products, consumer goods and telecommunications products.
<p>

Our current efforts are aimed at developing sales of telecommunications equipment and services, computer and software goods, informatics, health care products and medical devices, agri-food items and architectural/engineering products and services.  This 

is primarily due to strong market demand, the capability of Canadian companies to deliver competitive products in these sectors, and the presence of sector-oriented corporations and trade associations in the region.
<p>

The Trade and Investment Development Section helps Canadian companies to obtain information on export strategies, market intelligence and information, regional contact information, and retail/distribution patterns.  The Section maintains an up-to-date lis

ting of business agents experienced in working with Canadian firms.  Additionally, the Section provides advice to assist Canadians in developing a sustainable marketing plan and presence in the mid-Atlantic market.
<p>

Qualifying Canadian businesses may take advantage of the Program for Export Market Development (PEMD) to meet prospective agents, visit the marketplace and participate in mid-Atlantic trade events.
<p>

<h3>What We Do for <a name="U.S.">U.S.</a> Firms</h3>

The Section makes every effort to provide appropriate and timely information on products and services available in Canada by drawing on the resources of a computer-based information system, WIN Exports, which contains a database of some 17,000 Canadian co

mpanies.  The Section also regularly consults with industry sector specialists and Canadian industrial and trade associations in Canada in this sourcing process.
<p>

We provide information to prospective U.S. investors on the Canadian investment climate, on investment opportunities in Canada, and on Federal, Provincial and Municipal Government contacts, and private sector contacts, including site locators and financie

rs in Canada.
<p>

<h3><a name="Investment">Investment</a></h3>

In delivering our mandate to promote Canada as a destination for investment, we underscore the following factors which make the investment climate especially conducive to new business activity:
<p>

<ul type=square>

<li>Canadian corporate profits have increased by 50% in 1994;<br>
<li>Business confidence is at its highest level in 15 years;<br>
<li>OECD forecasts Canada to lead the G& countries in economic growth in 1995;<br>
<li>Gross inflows of foreign direct investment have more than doubled in recent years;<br>
<li>Exports continue to increase at record levels;<br>
<li>Inflation rates remain at a consistently low level;<br>
<li>Canada has an educated, skilled and committed workforce having low turnover and absenteeism rates;<br>
<li>Canada has a world-class infrastructure;<br>
<li>Under NAFTA, companies with operations in Canada have immediate access to a market of 360 million consumers with a combined GDP of $8.5 trillion.<p>
</ul>

Additionally, Government has played a role of fiscal responsibility, leading significant deregulation and privatization, establishing a welcoming climate for international business, putting in place quality social services and education, and maintaining a

 competitive R&amp;D tax regime.

<LI><A HREF="#1">Are You Infected?</A>
<LI><A HREF="#2">Technical Information</A>
<LI><A HREF="#3">Fix</A>
<LI><A HREF="#4">Product Specific Advice</A>
</UL>

<P>A new virus which is capable of being spread via <I>Word</I> Document files
has been discovered. The virus, named Winword.Concept, is automatically executed
whenever an infected document is opened within <I>Microsoft Word</I>. Once
active, all documents using the File 'Save As' menu item are auto- matically
infected.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="1">Are You Infected?</A></H2>
<P>Run Word and open the Tools/Macro menu. If you see a macro named <B><CODE>AAAZFS</CODE></B> on the list, you may be infected. For a definitive test, refer to the FIX
section below.</P>
[A] screen shot of the macro list on an infected machine [is shown.]

<H2><A NAME="2">Technical information</A></H2>
<P><IMG SRC="ncsa-1.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10>
Infected document files contain a <I>Microsoft WordBasic</I> macro which is
capable of attaching itself to other documents. These copies can them- selves
replicate when infected documents are opened.</P>
<P>The macro names used by the virus are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> <CODE><B>AAAZAO</B></CODE></LI>
<LI> <CODE><B>AAAZFS</B></CODE></LI>
<LI> <CODE><B>AutoOpen</B></CODE></LI>
<LI> <CODE><B>FileSaveAs</B></CODE></LI>
<LI> <CODE><B>PayLoad</B></CODE></LI>  
</UL>
<P>Note that &quot;<B>AutoOpen</B>&quot; and &quot;<B>FileSaveAs</B>&quot;
are legitimate macros that some users may already have on their system.<BR CLEAR=RIGHT></P>
<P>The macro virus becomes active via <I>Microsoft Word</I>'s &quot;<B>AutoOpen
</B>&quot; macro. For reference, the &quot;<B>AutoOpen</B>&quot; macro executes
each time you open a document.</P>
<P>The first thing the macro virus does is check the global document template,
typically &quot;<B>NORMAL.DOT</B>&quot;, for the presence of either a macro
named &quot;<B>PayLoad</B>&quot; or &quot;<B>FileSaveAs</B>&quot;. If either
macro is found, the routine aborts and no infection of the global document
template occurs.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="ncsa-2.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10>
During the course of copying the macros to the global document template, a
small dialog box with an &quot;Ok&quot; button appears on the screen. The dialog
box simply contains the number &quot;1&quot; as its only text. The title bar of
the dialog box indicates it is a <I>Microsoft Word</I> dialog box. This dialog
will only be shown during the initial infection.</P>
<P>Once these macros are added to the global document template, they replicate
by means of the virus version of 'File Save' command. Consequently any document
created using File Save As will contain this macro virus. An uninfected user can
simply open the document and become infected. Note that the &quot;<B>PayLoad
</B>&quot; macro contains the following text:</P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE> Sub MAIN<BR>
  REM That's enough to prove my point<BR>
End Sub</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>However, &quot;<B>PayLoad</B>&quot; is not executed at any time. Because of
the flexibility of <I>Microsoft's WordBasic</I> macro language, almost anything
could be performed here (including a file delete or other potentially damaging
operating system commands).<BR CLEAR=RIGHT></P>
<P>Also note that <I>Word</I> is available in many different languages, and in
some versions the macro language commands have also been translated. This has
the effect that macros written with English version of <I>Word</I> will not
work in, for example, Finnish version of <I>Word</I>. The result is that users
of such national version of <I>Word</I> will not get infected by this virus.
However, using an infected document in a translated version of Word will not
produce any errors, and the infection will stay intact even if the document is
re-saved. Such users are instructed to check for the presence of the virus in
any case, in order not to spread infected DOC files further.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="3">Fix</A></H2>
<P>Since the &quot;<B>AutoOpen</B>&quot; macro first checks for the presence
of a &quot;<B>PayLoad</B>&quot; or &quot;<B>FileSaveAs</B>&quot; macro before
continuing, simply creating a &quot;<B>PayLoad</B>&quot; macro that does
nothing is sufficient to prevent the virus from spreading. However, that this is
only a temporary solution as the &quot;<B>AutoOpen</B>&quot; macro could be
modified to simply infect the document template regardless of whether a &quot;<B>
PayLoad</B>&quot; or a &quot;<B>FileSaveAs</B>&quot; macro exists.</P>
<P>We recommend you download the file <B>ftp://ftp.ncsa.com/pub/wvfix.zip</B>.
This is a freeware fix produced by <I>Command Software Systems</I>, which is
designed to detect the presence of the virus, and prevent its subsequent
installation.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="4">Product specific advice</A></H2>
<P>Anti-virus vendors are already at work supplying the necessary updates to
deal with this new threat. Contact your supplier for more details.</P>

<center> <h1>What is Snapshots?</h1></center> 
<hr align="center" size=4 width=75%> <p>
 Snapshots is a quarterly publication produced by the Tourism Section of the 
Canadian
Embassy (Washington, D.C.) for the Travel Trade &amp; Media industries in the 
United
States.<p>

 Because the intended reader is the American consumer, Snapshots is produced in 
English
only.<p>

 Snapshots has been produced quarterly since summer 1994.  The edition available 
currently
 at this
Web site is<a href="snap34.html"> vol 3, issue 4.</a>
 There is also a 
<a href="snacal34.html">current calendar of Canadian 
tourism events.</a><p>

 Attention is given to achieving a balance in geographical representation of all 
provinces
and territories in Canada.  As well, attention is given to profiling all aspects of 

travel
to Canada.  Submission of unsolicited articles is welcome, although no guarantee of
publication is extended.<p>

 Snapshots represents a collaborative effort amongst the Tourism Sections of the 
Canadian
Embassy and the Canadian Consulates General in Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, 
Dallas,
Detroit, Minneapolis and New York City; the Canadian Consulate in Miami and the 
Canadian
Government Trade Offices in Cincinnati and Pittsburgh.  Distribution of the hard 
copies
across the U.S. could only be achieved via the individual mailings originating from 

the
above listed Consulates.  Each quarter over 13,000 copies are distributed.<p>

 All information included in Snapshots is accurate to the knowledge of the Tourism
Sections of The Canadian Embassy (Washington, D.C.) and the Canadian Consulates 
General in
Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Minneapolis and New York City; 
the
Canadian Consultate in Miami and the Canadian Government Trade Offices in 
Cincinnati  and
Pittsburgh.  <p>

 Information is subject to change. At printing, information was considered correct.

<h2><a name="stretch">Stretch Your Dollar</a></h2>

Take 30% off when you choose Canada!  Although the exchange rate changes daily, 
the average currency exchange has been $1 U.S. = $1.30 Canadian.  	<p>
FOR EXAMPLE....if a hotel in Canada quotes you a room rate of $100 a night, don't
forget that it means $100 Canadian...and for you it really means approximately $77 
U.S.!	<p>
AND for additional savings, reclaim the 7% Goods and Services Tax (GST).  Ask for 
a
GST refund form at your hotel, at shops or at Customs.  The tax is refundable on
accommodations and goods purchased in and taken out of Canada.<p>

REMEMBER that U.S. residents returning from Canada after more than 48 hours may
take back, free of duty, $400 U.S. worth of articles for personal or household use. 

 Included in
this exemption is one litre of alcoholic beverage, 1 carton of cigarettes (200) and 

up to 100 cigars.<p>
<hr align="center" size=2 width=50%>

<h2><a name="helping">Helping Hand</a></h2>

To facilitate your clients' vacation planning, we have included information phone 
numbers
as well as FAX numbers throughout Snapshots to assist you in contacting various 
tourism and
information offices in Canada.  Don't forget to ask about Group Tours!<p>
<hr align="center" size=2 width=50%>

<a name="plan">Plan Ahead</a>

Each of Canada's ten provinces, select territories and select cities have 
toll-free telephone
numbers for their Tourism and Travel offices.  Ask for maps, brochures on special 
events and
accommodation information.  From west coast to east coast, Canada has a lot to 
offer!<p>

<h2><a name="flavours">The Many Flavours of Kitchener-Waterloo</a></h2>


Mention Kitchener-Waterloo (in south-central Ontario) and many think of 
Oktoberfest,
the largest Bavarian festival in the world after Munich.  As the name suggests, the 

festival does
take place in October and yes, there is great entertainment for the family, great 
beer, sausage and
sauerkraut.<p>

However, you can come to the Kitchener-Waterloo area and taste all these flavours
year-round.  <p>

Gemuetlichkeit, in German, means welcome and enjoy yourself.  There is so much to 
see
and do in our area.  Although we are primarily a German heritage community, there 
are Scottish,
Portuguese and East European groups that enrich us as well.<p>

 Located one hour west of Toronto off Highway 401, Kitchener-Waterloo has many 
other
festivals throughout the year, such as Elmira Maple Syrup, Wellesley Apple Butter 
and Cheese,
Buskers and a popular Quilt Auction put on by our Mennonites.  You will often see 
Mennonites
travelling the countryside in their buggys, but remember, they don't like to have 
their pictures
taken.<p>

 During the summer months our many farmers' markets are filled with fresh produce 
&amp;
baked goods.  Many of the markets are open during the week through the summer so 
you will
have a chance to pick up some of these tasty delights. <p>

 Often there will be local artisans at the market as well.  Kitchener-Waterloo is 
known for
weavers, quilters and potters.  In addition to the farmers' markets you will find 
other unique
shopping throughout the region.<p>

 Summer theatre is popular in the towns and villages that surround 
Kitchener-Waterloo and
the largest repertory company in North America - the Stratford Festival - is only 
30 minutes away.<p>

 Driving the backroads is a relaxing way to discover our area.  Unwind after a day 
of
exploration in one of our many rural Bed &amp; Breakfasts.  If a quiet sleep is 
important, other than
the odd rooster crowing or cow mooing, check into this type of accommodation.  The 
area
features a full range of accommodations from campgrounds to first class hotels.<p>

 Visitor magazine has all this information at your fingertips.  Plan a day trip if 
you are in
Toronto or plan your next vacation and make Kitchener-Waterloo your prime 
destination.  You
won't be disappointed.  Call ahead for a copy of Visitor magazine.  Call

<h2><a name="carol">My Hometown...Carol's Winnipeg</a></h2>


Carol Shields is an award-winning writer.  Born near Chicago, Ms. Shields moved to 
Canada in
1957 and has made Winnipeg her home since 1980.  Ms. Shields was interviewed at the 

Canadian
Embassy (Washington, DC) during a recent book tour. <p>

<p>

 "Many consider my love of Winnipeg to be perverse"...and so began Carol Shields'
explanation of why she enjoys her hometown.  "Winnipeg is the optimum size for a 
city.  Some
days I feel like I know everyone I meet downtown."<p>

 Being recognized by Carol Shields in downtown Winnipeg is not difficult to 
believe.  After
a brief chat, it is clear that  Shields' interest in people - their stories, their 
present, their future is
quite sincere and could only be accommodated in a city like Winnipeg.  "Winnipeg is 

an open
society and very welcoming to visitors,"  Shields explains from personal 
experience.  Born in Oak
Park, Illinois in 1935, Ms. Shields married a Canadian and moved to Ottawa in 1957. 

 In 1980,
she and her family moved to Winnipeg. <p>

 Her first impressions?  "I was scared of Winnipeg because it looked so isolated."  

Shields
describes how the land - the prairies - impresses itself upon your psyche.  "There 
is no escaping
the land in Winnipeg.  You feel it in the downtown core and within 30 minutes you 
can be outside
of the city and surrounded by wheat fields.  This truly is a tremendous, comforting 

feeling."<p>

 Yes, there is no denying that winters are to be taken seriously in Winnipeg but 
Shields
scoffs at the old joke of calling Winnipeg "Winter-peg".  She explains in a factual 

tone, "It is cold
in winter" and then adds with a charming smile, "The cold makes you only want to 
huddle." 
Shields explains further that you live through the harsh climate in winter.  "My 
husband and I
always take a daily walk.  We wrap ourselves up and away we go, although my 
parents, who
retired in Florida, could not believe it.  And yes," she adds quickly, "summer is 
heaven".<p>

 Favourite summertime activities include enjoying the flourishing cafe society.  
"The people
of Winnipeg are at ease with interaction,"  Shields says, retelling wonderful 
afternoons spent at
outdoor cafes chatting with friends, old and new.  <p>

 Restaurants are plentiful and Shields and her husband have their favourites.  
"Every
Saturday we have breakfast at Caffe Ciao and we recently had dinner at Cafe La 
Scala.  There are
so many great places to eat" and Shields enthusiastically mentions the 
trattoria-style restaurant
Caffe Carlos, the "lovely" Le Beaujolais, and the "terrific" Sofia.  An old 
favourite is Alycia's.<p>

 Shields' love of fine food is equally matched by her appreciation for fine 
architecture and
Winnipeg can also fulfill those interests.  "The Exchange District of Winnipeg is 
the old
warehouse area, and the integrity of the buildings has been beautifully preserved.  

The open
markets and the individual houses are all pretty remarkable."  She enthusiastically 

details that the
Golden Boy on top the Legislative Building is 14 1/2 feet tall!<p>

 Shields passionately describes the people of Winnipeg in saying that "they are the 

salt of
the earth.  Living in Winnipeg is not at all like living in a small town - there 
are not the perceived
restrictions."  It certainly sounds as if Carol Shields is truly at home.<p>

<h2><a name="bridge">The Bridge to Prince Edward Island</a></h2>

A new guided tour is available on Prince Edward Island, but the point of interest 
is not
hundreds of years old or even ten years old. In fact, the site will not even be 
completed until June
1997! <p>

The newest attraction is the construction of a nine mile bridge, referred to as 
the
"Northumberland Strait Bridge" until a formal name is given, which will connect 
Borden, Prince
Edward Island to Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick .  For the first time, Canada's 
island province
will be connected to the mainland. <p>

Strait Crossing Tours offers the thirty-five minute exploration which takes place 
in and
around the pre-fabrication yard where the bridge is being constructed. Guides 
explain the
construction process, the equipment being used, the environmental aspects of 
building the bridge
and the economic impact the bridge will have. <p>

The most recent development is the arrival of a 100.2 meter high crane from France 
that
will move heavy pilings into place. The bridge will ultimately consist of concrete 
spans, each 207
yards long, on pilings each 55 yards tall.<p>

The bridge's greatest challenge will be the brutal winter conditions in 
Northumberland
Strait. As reported in The Washington Post, winds up to 50 miles an hour often 
cause the ice
from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to enter the Strait and accumulate to heights of 20 
to 30 feet. The
ice and the wind could prove to be damaging to the bridge, but architects promise 
that the bridge
will beat the ice because each piling is armed with a shield that will cause the 
ice to break before it
becomes dangerous. <p>

The tours depart every hour on the hour beginning at 9:00 am until 4:00 pm. The 
price, in
Canadian dollars, is $6.00 for adults, $5.25 for seniors and $3.00 for children.

more information contact Strait Crossing Tours at (902) 437-7273 or Prince Edward 
Island

        <font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        is DBS?</strong></em></font><font size="2"
        face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">A new
        class of television services have recently become
        available to viewers in the continental United States.
        These services allow households to receive television
        programming directly from satellites on small (18 inch)
        satellite dishes which are not movable but instead are
        aimed at one position in the sky.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The
        signals are digitally compressed, allowing several
        programs to be broadcast from a single satellite
        transponder thereby allowing up to 400 channels
        receivable with a dish pointed at one orbital position in
        the sky.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Programming
        on the various services includes most major cable services,
        sports, Pay Per View (PPV) movies, audio services, and specialized
        &quot;niche&quot; programming aimed at smaller audiences. These
        services are often referred to as Direct To Home (DTH) services
        or Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) services.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Several
        years ago the FCC reserved a portion of broadcast spectrum
        and reserved several U.S. satellite orbital positions for
        a class of television service they called Direct
        Broadcast Satellite (DBS). The satellite locations are
        spaced nine degrees apart from others broadcasting in the
        same frequency range (rather than two for conventional
        satellites) and these satellites are allowed to broadcast
        at a higher power providing interference-free reception on
        very small satellite dishes. This is the FCC's definition
        of DBS and they have specifically licensed several
        companies to provide DBS services.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">It is also
        possible for companies who are not licensed DBS broadcasters
        to offer Direct To Home services from conventional satellites.
        To the consumer these Direct To Home services look identical
        to licensed DBS services, except that they generally require
        a somewhat larger dish (although still much smaller than conventional
        dishes) and they also require professional installation. As
        a result, the definition of DBS is now generally used for
        any Direct To Home service using small satellite dishes
        from a fixed satellite position.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">There are
        currently four DBS services in operation with others expected
        to begin in the coming months. Although they still have
        far fewer subscribers than the Cable TV industry, DBS
        services are rapidly adding subscribers and the industry
        has very strong growth potential. As a result, many
        companies are interested in getting into the DBS
        business.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        DBS services are available today?</strong></em></font><font
        size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong><br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The first
        service is provided by two separate companies, DIRECTV (TM)
        (a subsidiary of Hughes Communications) and United States Satellite
        Broadcasting Company (USSB). Both companies are FCC licensed
        DBS providers and as such they operate from specially designed
        High Powered DBS satellites receivable with 18 inch dishes.
        The DIRECTV/USSB service was the first High Powered DBS service
        and is considered the premier DBS service in the U.S.
        They have signed up nearly two million subscribers in
        their first two years of operation capturing over half of
        the DBS market.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The second
        service is another FCC licensed DBS service called EchoStar.
        Their 18 inch dish service started in spring of 1996 so they
        have only a small market share at this time, but their
        service is proving to be very popular and they are adding
        subscribers at a rate comparable to the other DBS
        services. EchoStar has entered the market with very
        inexpensive hardware and programming which has proven to
        be very popular with price-sensitive subscribers and which
        has caused other providers to lower hardware and software prices.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        equipment is needed?</strong></em></font><font size="2"
        face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong><br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Each
        service provider sells or leases reception hardware that includes
        a dish, a decoder, and a remote control. A single decoder can
        decode a single channel which can then be routed to
        several TV sets and VCRs throughout a household.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">A separate
        decoder is needed for each TV or VCR that subscribers want
        to be able to view a different channel on simultaneously. Therefore
        to watch two different channels simultaneously or to tape one
        channel while watching another a household must have two decoders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The FCC
        defined DBS services (DIRECTV/USSB and EchoStar) use systems
        that allow subscribers to self-install their equipment, although
        many choose professional installation. The other services require
        professional installation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        compression systems do the DBS services use?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Each of
        the DBS services transmits a bitstream which contains compressed
        audio, compressed video, authorization information, program
        guide information and other information. The decoders in each
        subscriber's homes decode the digital bitstream
        converting it into video and audio which can be displayed
        by conventional TV sets. Each service requires a decoder
        designed to work with its system.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The video
        compression format is the MPEG-2 compression standard. The
        EchoStar service use a transmission system based on the
        DVB standard being pushed by some companies as a world
        broadcast standard. DVB uses the standard MPEG-2 and also
        attempts to standardize more of the systems.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>Does
        this mean the decoders are interchangeable between
        services?</strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">No. There
        is absolutely no decoder standardization in the DBS world.
        Each service sells or leases their own decoders. While
        many parts of the systems are common, each service
        provider's broadcast bitstream contains some proprietary
        information which only their decoder can understand. In
        order to change to another service subscribers must
        either sell or otherwise exchange their decoders for one
        designed for the new service. This includes DVB compliant decoders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">It doesn't
        really make much difference what transmission system is used
        by the DBS providers since they all can create similar
        quality audio and video.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        is EchoStar's Dish Network?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">EchoStar
        is the second High Power DBS service in the U.S. They started
        operation in early March 1996 and have already signed up several
        thousand customers thus far. They are currently offering about
        100 channels from their 119 degree orbital position where they
        control 21 broadcast frequencies.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Their
        first High Power satellite is called EchoStar-1.
        EchoStar-2 is planned for launch in early in 1997 and
        should add approximately 50 channels.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">EchoStar
        uses a DVB compliant system called the DISH(TM) Network
        which sells for $200 for the basic system and $300 for a step-up
        when a prepaid programming subscription is purchased. Their
        decoder has a high-speed data port for future use.
        EchoStar says their system can be self-installed so they
        sell an installation kit as well.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">EchoStar
        programming is currently priced lower than the other DBS services.
        They offer a basic package of about 35 channels for $20 per
        month. Additional packages which include multichannel premium
        services and digital audio services sell for $30 and $40
        per month.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">They also
        have a few PPV channels as well with prices about $3 per movie.
        They don't yet have the channel capacity for many of the services
        offered by other DBS companies such as professional sport packages,
        but that is expected to change as they add channel capacity
        over the coming months.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">EchoStar
        is the only DBS service to offer any of the Star Trek
        series programming.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        is the DIRECTV/USSB service?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The
        DIRECTV/USSB service is the premier DBS service available today
        offering up to 200 video channels. This service uses
        three Ku-band satellites which operate from one fixed
        position in the sky. The first (DBS1) uses sixteen
        120-watt transponders while the other two (DBS2 and DBS3)
        are configured to each use eight 240-watt transponders.
        This results in a total of 32 broadcast transponders.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The
        hardware used by DIRECTV and USSB is called Digital
        Satellite System or DSS(TM). Sony, Thomson Consumer
        Electronics (owner of the Proscan, RCA, and GE names),
        Hughes Network Systems, Toshiba, and possibly others now
        build the DSS receiving equipment. Additional
        manufacturers have been licensed to sell the units
        including Uniden, Matsushita (Panasonic), Samsung, Sanyo, and
        Daewoo. The decoders are sold through both satellite
        dealers and consumer electronics retailers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        and USSB customers must purchase their decoders. Prices
        range from about $300 to $500 depending on the models. Prices
        are expected to drop to under $200 by the end of the year
        as a result of competition with EchoStar.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Thomson
        currently sells hardware under the ProScan, RCA, and GE names.
        Their current models are their second generation units
        with several updates over their first systems including
        one-touch recording from the program guide. Hughes
        Network Systems (HNS) packages are also available.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Each
        manufacturer of DSS equipment differentiates their
        product by providing a unique user interface including
        their own on-line program guide with a different look and
        feel and different remote controls. The program guides
        contain programming information such as descriptions of
        upcoming episodes and scheduled talk-show guests. Each
        manufacturer also can choose whether or not to include
        certain features such as a Favorite Channel list or a Universal
        remote control.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">AT&amp;T
        also sells DSS hardware as well as DIRECTV and USSB programming
        directly to their long-distance customers. They have invested
        significantly in DIRECTV.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">What
        DIRECTV and USSB programming is available and what does
        it cost?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        and USSB share the rights to all 32 broadcast frequencies at
        the 101 degree west orbital position. The FCC has issued
        USSB five of the frequencies so USSB broadcasts from five
        transponders on one of the 120-watt satellites giving
        them about 25 channels. DIRECTV has been issued 27
        frequencies and programs about 150 channels.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The
        combined DIRECTV/USSB programming breakdown is approximately
        as follows: 70 Channels of major cable services 50 Channels
        of subscription sports 20 Channels of special interest/niche
        services and promotional channels 50 Channels of Pay Per
        View (PPV) movies<br>
        10 Promotional Channels 200 Total Channels</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">USSB
        features HBO and Showtime premium services and that is
        the foundation upon which they are basing their business.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        currently broadcasts about 175 channels. Their programming
        can be broken down into five areas: cable programming,
        subscription sports, music services, Pay Per View (PPV)
        movies, and special interest/niche services. There is no
        free DIRECTV programming.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        sells programming packages based on popular cable services
        which range in price from $6 to about $35 per month. In addition,
        they sell several other services ala carte.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        offers subscriptions to most major professional and some college
        sporting events. They use the addressable nature of the decoders
        to allow reception only in certain geographic locations such
        as outside the local broadcast coverage areas.
        Significant local black-out rules apply meaning many
        games viewers may want to watch are not available in
        their area.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        offers Pay Per View (PPV) movies time-shifted on about 50 channels
        with many starting at intervals of at most 30 minutes. Prices
        for PPV movies are usually $3 when ordered through the
        DSS remote control and $5 when ordered over the phone.
        Occasionally movies are offered at a slightly lower or
        higher price.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The DSS
        system has built in copy protection technology which can control
        whether or not a PPV movie can be recorded. DIRECTV has not
        used it in their first two years of service and are
        expected to rarely use it. USSB says they have no plans
        to ever use it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Customers
        with more than one DSS decoder in a household pay an additional
        $1 per month for the second USSB subscription and an additional
        $2 for a second DIRECTV subscription.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>How
        do I connect a DBS decoder to my home audio/video system?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">There are
        plenty of options for hooking the decoders into a home
        A/V system. TV sets with S-video inputs can use the
        S-video output jack on the decoder allowing the display
        of pure component (Y/C) video as it was uplinked to the
        satellite. This appears to be most advantageous on those
        channels which are broadcast using digital tape or fiber
        optic cable as the source. On those channels, use of the Y/C
        port can avoid the conversion from the digital component
        signal to NTSC making very high quality images possible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Viewers
        who choose to use the RF output to connect their TV sets
        do not get stereo or surround sound audio to their TV
        speakers. Stereo sound is available only through the
        direct audio output jacks from a DBS decoder.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>How
        is the DBS equipment installed?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The DSS
        and DISH hardware were both designed to be easy to install
        with no professional equipment required. The dishes can
        be installed anywhere there is a direct line of sight to
        the satellite with no trees or buildings in the way. Each
        service broadcasts all its channels from one position in
        the sky so the dish does not need to move. The dishes
        typically have a built-in audible signal meter or blinking
        LED to indicate signal strength to help position them
        during installation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Homeowners
        can install the hardware, but professional installation is
        recommended. Thomson says the suggested retail price of a
        DSS basic installation is $200 but some installers charge
        lower fees. More complex installations cost more.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Self-installation
        kits are also available for both the DSS and DISH systems
        for about $70. These typically contain cables, a compass,
        a grounding block, a telephone T connector, and all
        hardware necessary to mount the dish and connect it up.
        They also typically include a videotape which
        demonstrates the installation process. All the necessary
        cables can be purchased at Radio Shack or other similar
        retailers, but those who don't have easy access to
        supplies may want to consider the self-installation kit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>What
        about watching the broadcast networks and local channels?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The DBS
        services offer packages of network stations to customers
        in rural areas. As specified in the Satellite Home Viewer
        Act recently renewed in 1994, these channels are
        available only to customers who are not within the
        terrestrial coverage areas of network affiliates. Those
        who can receive network affiliates will not be able to
        purchase this package and therefore must get network programming
        over the air (or by some other means).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">I live in
        the city where there are tall buildings, can I receive
        DBS service?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">You must
        have a direct view of the satellite to get any DBS
        service with no trees or buildings in the way. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>Can
        I connect more than one TV to a single dish?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">The DBS
        dishes connect to the decoders with coaxial cable. The dish
        electronics have either one or two coaxial connections depending
        on the model so at most two decoders can be connected to
        one dish. It is important to purchase a package which can
        allow more than one decoder to connect to a dish if
        viewers ever want to hook up more than one decoder in a
        household.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Channel
        Master and perhaps other companies sell a MultiSwitch which
        takes both coaxial outputs from the dish and allows up to
        four decoders to be connected to it. Note that the base
        units from most manufacturers can only be connected to
        one decoder, so the Deluxe unit is necessary in this
        configuration.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DIRECTV
        and USSB say in order to authorize more than one decoder at
        a location, there must be a telephone connection at each
        decoder.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em>Is the
        telephone connection really necessary for the DIRECTV/USSB
        service?</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Yes if you
        want to take advantage of all services available from DIRECTV.
        The phone line is used to verify the location of the DSS unit
        and manage the blackout restrictions imposed by the professional
        sports leagues.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">You must
        be connected to a phone line to be authorized to receive regional
        sports networks or pro sports packages. It is also
        required to purchase impulse PPV movies and other special
        events.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Many
        viewers have never connected their systems to a phone
        line and don't feel they need it. Some recreational
        vehicle owners take the DSS system with them when they
        travel and others take systems to cabins or other remote
        locations occasionally where no phone line is available.</font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>Will
        DBS hardware prices drop in the near future?<br>
        </strong></em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">DBS
        decoder prices have dropped drastically in the last few
        months mostly in response to very low prices introduced
        by a recently-announced EchoStar promotion. DISH
        equipment is now priced at $200 to $300 when purchased
        with a pre-paid programming subscription which has
        severely undercut other providers' prices. This promotion
        has proven to be very popular and is rapidly expanding
        EchoStar's customer base. DIRECTV and USSB have plans to
        match the prices using rebates and other promotions so a
        $200 DSS hardware system is expected by fall of 1996.
        This represents a drastic drop from the $700 to $900
        price of first generation decoders two years ago.<br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold"><em><strong>Where
        can I get more information?</strong></em><br>
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial Rounded MT Bold">You can

<P><IMG SRC="ciac.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="" HSPACE=10>
<A NAME="1">Macro viruses</A>, that's right, its plural now. Currently at least two macro
viruses in the wild infect <I>Microsoft Word</I> documents; the <I>WinWord.Concept</I> 
(<I>Word Prank</I>) and <I>WordMacro.Nuclear</I> viruses. Both of these
viruses infect document files for <I>Microsoft Word</I> version 6 or later on
any platform. The viruses don't overwrite a document, but attach a macro program
to the document that is loaded and run when the document is loaded. These first
two viruses are not particularly damaging, but could easily have been so.</P>
<P><I>Microsoft Word</I> version 6 and later have a macro capability known as
<I>WordBasic</I> (for more information, choose the Programming with <I>Microsoft
Word</I> section in the Word Help Contents). <I>WordBasic</I> is essentially
the Basic programming language with extensions to make it easy to access the
contents of open documents. <I>WordBasic</I> was intended to be used to perform
special editing and formatting tasks that were not part of Word's built-in
command set. A publisher I know uses <I>WordBasic</I> to initialize a writer's
document, insert standard headers and footers, and set the default formatting.
Most Word users don't even know they have it, but it is available in all the
current versions. If you are using a version of Word that does not have <I>WordBasic</I>, 
you are not at risk. To see if you have <I>WordBasic</I>, see if a Macro
command exists on the Tools menu. If so, then you have <I>WordBasic</I>.</P>
<P>Like most macro capabilities, <I>WordBasic</I> has the capability of
creating auto execute (<B>AutoExe</B>), auto open (<B>AutoOpen</B>), and auto
close (<B>AutoClose</B>) macros, which are the mechanisms the viruses use to
take control of a computer and install themselves. An auto execute macro is one
that automatically runs every time you start Word. The auto open and auto close
macros run whenever you open or close the document they are attached to. When
you open an infected document, its auto open macro runs and installs an auto
execute macro in your global macro file (<B>normal.dot</B>). Once that is done,
the virus code is executed every time you startup Word. The virus code then
writes copies of itself onto every document you save with Word.</P>
<P><I>WordBasic</I> is an interpreted language, that is, the programs are
written in text form, which are read and executed whenever the program is run.
This facility makes the code and the virus independent of the platform they are
running on. The virus does not have to be written in machine language, but runs
on any machine with a <I>WordBasic</I> interpreter. Thus, the viruses run
equally well on a <I>Macintosh</I>, or any machine running <I>Windows</I> or
<I>Windows</I> NT.</P>  
<H2><A NAME="2">WinWord.Concept (Word Prank)</A></H2>
<P>This is the first virus discovered of this type. It does nothing but
replicate itself. You can detect the virus the first time it executes, because a
dialog box appears containing the single digit 1. After the first infection, you
can detect an infection by looking for the following line in the <B>WINWORD6.INI</B> file in the <B>WINDOWS </B>directory.</P> 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>WW6I=1</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Microsoft has made a disinfector available to detect and remove this virus
from a system and from infected documents. The disinfector is a document named
<B>scan831.doc</B>. It is available directly from Microsoft at:</P><UL>
<LI>The Microsoft World Wide Web site at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice"><CODE>http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice</CODE></A> 
<LI>The <I>Microsoft Network MSN(tm)</I> using <B>go</B> word: <B>wordprankfix</B>
<LI>The <I>Word</I> forums on other on-line services such as <I>CompuServe(C)</I> and
<LI><I>America Online(C)</I>
<LI>Customers can also get the tool by calling <I>Microsoft's Product
Support Services</I> at <B>206-462-9673</B> for <I>Word for Windows</I>, and
<B>206-635-7200</B> for <I>Word for the Macintosh</I>.
<LI>On the CIAC archive, at <A HREF="http://ciac.llnl.gov"><CODE>http://ciac.llnl.gov</CODE></A>
</UL>
<P>To use <B>scan831.doc</B>, simply open it with Word. As soon as it is
opened, it innoculates your system against the virus and cleans any infected
documents as you save them. It also contains a procedure called <B>CleanAll
</B>, which can be used to check and clean individual files or whole directories
of files.</P>  
<H2><A NAME="3">WordMacro.Nuclear</A></H2>
<P>The <I>WordMacro.Nuclear</I> virus is similar in operation to the <I>WinWord.Concept
</I> virus in how it infects files, but contains an additional payload. This
virus contains a dropper for a DOS virus, as well as the document infector, and
if the date is April 5th, it deletes <B>command.com</B>.</P>
<P>You can detect the virus by listing the macros installed in Word, using the
Tools Macros command. In the Macro dialog box that appears, make sure that the
<B>Macros Available In:</B> box is set to: <B>All Active Templates</B>. If all
the macros in the following list are listed in the Macro Name list, you probably
have the virus. If only some are there, you probably don't.</P><UL>
<LI><CODE>AutoExec</CODE>
<LI><CODE>AutoOpen</CODE>
<LI><CODE>DropSuriv</CODE>
<LI><CODE>FileExit</CODE>
<LI><CODE>FilePrint</CODE>
<LI><CODE>FilePrintDefault</CODE>
<LI><CODE>FileSaveAs</CODE>
<LI><CODE>InsertPayload</CODE>
<LI><CODE>Payload</CODE>
</UL>

<P>You can also detect the virus when printing a document during the last 5
seconds of any minute. If you do, the following text appears at the top of the
printed page.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;And finally I would like to say:&quot;<BR>
&quot;STOP ALL FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTING IN THE PACIFIC!&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is not known at this time if <B>scan831.doc</B> will protect or remove
this virus. To install some protection by hand, create an <B>AutoExec</B> macro
in your <B>normal.dot</B> file. It does not have to do anything, it just has to
be there. If the virus finds this macro already in the <B>normal.dot</B> file
it does not infect a machine.</P>
<P>To clean documents and normal.dot by hand, you must delete all the macros in
the above list from the document's and from <B>normal.dot</B>'s macro list.
Note again that all of the macros in the above list must be present for the
virus to work. If only some are present, they likely came from some other
source, for example, <B>scan831.doc</B> installs a <B>Payload</B> and an <B>AutoClose
</B> macro in your <B>normal.doc</B> template, which you don't want to delete.
To delete a macro from a file, open the file and select the Tools Macro command.
On the Macro dialog box, click the Organizer button. On the Organizer dialog
box, click the Macros tab and you will see two lists. One is usually set to the
normal.dot file and the other is available. Click on a macro name and click
Delete to remove it. To open another file to clean it, click Open File to select
and open the file, then delete any macros.</P>  
<H2><A NAME="4">Other Concerns</A></H2>
<P>Most popular packages have a macro capability, and thus are at risk to new
viruses of this type. Spreadsheets, project managers, database managers and word
processors all have a built-in macro capability. If you have these utilities and
are not using the macros, it would probably be a good idea to disable the
auto-execute capabilities if possible.</P>
<P>For example, in Word for Windows, holding Shift when starting the program or
opening a file disables any autoexecute macros that would have been started by
that action. To permanently disable auto-execute macros, add <B>/mDisableAutoMacros
</B> to the winword startup line. Select the Word icon in the Program Manager,
select File Properties, and in the Program Item Properties dialog box, add the
flag <B>/mDisableAutoMacros</B> to the right of the text in the Command Line
box, so it reads something like the following (Note that the path to <B>winword.exe
</B> may be different on your machine.)</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>c:\msoffice\winword\winword.exe/mdisableautomacros</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><B>The next time you start Word, all auto-execute macros will be disabled,
including those in the scan831.doc</B> file. To use auto-execute macros again,
you must remove the flag you just added.</P>

<title>Message - Unable to load operating system from start drive</title>
<h2>Message - Unable to load operating system from start drive</h2>
Last Updated: 7th January, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
During the boot procedure, the Boot Manager menu does not load.
Instead the following message (or one very similar) is displayed:
<pre>
   Unable to load operating system from start drive
</pre><br>
Even after using FDISK to remove Boot Manager and vary
the startable partition, it is still impossible to boot any
operating system from the drive.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
AMI BIOS<br>
540MB IDE HDD<br>
OS/2 Boot Manager in the first 1MB
<h2>Problem</h2>
The Master Boot Record is corrupted, possibly because
an old version of OS/2 FDISK has been used to manipulate the
partition map or because of bad disk geometry.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Only use this procedure as a last resort <strong>and at your own risk</strong>.
I can't guarantee that this procedure is completely safe. 
It appears to have worked for me, but I don't know if there are 
situations in which it may result
in loss of data. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Boot OS/2 from a floppy then type FDISK /NEWMBR at an OS/2 command prompt.
<p>
<li>Reboot
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
This situation occured because 
I was trying to delete some old Linux data and swap partitions
in order to reclaim the space for a 115MB HPFS partition
at the end of my 540MB IDE hard drive. For some reason Warp's
FDISK wouldn't let me do this (<a href="APARS/PJ15972.html">APAR PJ15972</a>) - it complained about
a corrupted partition table. The Warp Beta's FDISK did 
allow me to delete the partitions, but when I next rebooted,
the symptoms above were observed (see also: <a href="APARS/PJ15988.html">APAR PJ15988</a>).
<h2>See Also</h2>

<title>Bienvenue a l'ambassade du Canada aux &Eacute;tats-Unis</title>
</head>
<!-- This document was created on 16 Mar 95 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company, Ottawa, CANADA on behalf of the Embassy of Canada, Washington, DC  USA>

<hr>
<p>

L'ambassade du 501 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., abrite, outre le
bureau de l'ambassadeur, ceux de ses 290 employ&eacute;s.<p>
<p>
     Situ&eacute;e &agrave; l'intersection des avenues Pennsylvania
et Constitution, &agrave; quelques centaines de m&egrave;tres du
Capitole, elle fait face &agrave; la National Gallery of Art et
avoisine le parc John Marshall.<p>
<p>
     Influences n&eacute;o-classiques et modernes s'unissent dans
cet &eacute;difice de six &eacute;tages con&ccedil;u par le
Canadien Arthur Erickson, architecte prim&eacute;. La fa&ccedil;ade
de marbre lisse mais non poli de l'&eacute;difice s'harmonise avec
l'ensemble architectural o&ugrave; il s'ins&egrave;re.<p>
<p>
     Les trois ailes de l'ambassade et ses colonnes d'aluminium
mat, hautes de 15 m&egrave;tres, d&eacute;limitent une spacieuse
cour int&eacute;rieure. Dominant la cour, <I>The Spirit of Haida
Gwaii</I> de Bill Reid est un massif cano&euml; noir ancr&eacute;
dans le bassin peu profond qui s'incurve en ouest. L'embarcation,
moul&eacute; en bronze, transporte treize personnages de la
mythologie haida. L'ambassade du Canada est fi&egrave;re d'accueillir la
sculpture la plus grande et la plus complexe r&eacute;alis&eacute;e par l'artiste
haida.<p>
<p>
     Le mur qui domine la cour porte une tapisserie de fleurs et
d'arbustes, oeuvre de l'architecte-paysagiste Cornelia Oberlander
de Vancouver. Dans le coin sud-est de la cour, les douze colonnes
de la rotonde des province -- une pour chaque province ou
territoire -- entourent un jet d'eau retombant en cascade.<p>
<p>
     Les 25,000 m&egrave;tres carr&eacute;s de l'ambassade sont
occup&eacute;s par divers services (affaires &eacute;conomiques,
politiques, publiques; liaison en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;fense;
administration; et consulat), par un th&eacute;&acirc;tre de 175 places, une
galerie d'art, une biblioth&egrave;que de 20,000 volumes, une vaste
salle de r&eacute;ception appel&eacute;e Salon du Canada, une caf&eacute;t&eacute;ria r&eacute;serv&eacute;e
au personnel et un garage souterrain.
<p>
     Des oeuvres portant la signature d'artistes canadiens de
premier plan font partie int&eacute;grante de l'&eacute;difice. Une
centaine d'oeuvres -- sculptures, tableaux, gravures, photographies
et tapisseries -- sont des pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; long terme en
provenance des collections priv&eacute;es du minist&egrave;re des Affaires
&eacute;trang&egrave;res et du Commerce international. D'autres ont
&eacute;t&eacute; donn&eacute;es ou pr&ecirc;t&eacute;es par des
soci&eacute;t&eacute;s et des particuliers. Le gouvemement du
Canada est reconnaissant pour ces g&eacute;n&eacute;reux dons. 
<p>
     L'ambassade a &eacute;t&eacute; inaugur&eacute;e
officiellement le 3 mai 1989 apr&egrave;s trois ann&eacute;es de construction.

<title>Ontrack Disk Manager and Warp</title>
<h2>Ontrack Disk Manager and Warp</h2>
Last Updated: July 14, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
Many users report problems and incompatibilities when
installing Warp on an EIDE drive that uses Ontrack Disk Manager.
Ontrack itself states that an 'Advanced Installation' using
Boot Manager is not possible.
<p>
The following describes a <strong>successful installation</strong>
of all three on a new drive, producing:
<ul>
<li>a primary partition formatted with FAT for DOS (120M),
<li>an extended partition formatted with HPFS for OS/2 (500M), and
<li>Boot Manager (plus some free space for future use).
</ul>
Other configurations should be possible if you heed the caveats
stated below.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong>  The following is really more long-winded
than complicated.  Much of this was learned trying to install DM;
even more was learned later trying to remove it!
<h2>Hardware and Software</h2>
<p>
The software components used were:
<ul>
<li>Ontrack Disk Manager, v6.03, files dated 9/26/94
<li><tt>IBM1S506.ADD</tt>, file dated 2/13/95 (build date 950115)
<li><tt>OS2DASD.DMD</tt>, file dated 2/13/95
<li><tt>ONTRACK.FLT</tt>, file dated 12/2/94
<li>OS/2 Warp v3.0 for users with DOS & Windows
</ul>
The hardware used was:
<ul>
<li>Conner DS850A (850MB, newer model supporting PIO Mode 4)
<li>486DX-33 with an ISA bus and generic IDE controller
<li>AMI Bios dated 6/6/91
</ul>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Disk Manager is a BIOS extension which is loaded from disk at boot-up
and remaps the drive's cylinder and head geometry.  As part of its
remapping, it hides the real partition sector and itself (all on
cylinder 0, side 0) and remaps side 1 to side 0.  Side 1 has
another partition sector which Disk Manager boots once it has finished
loading. This is the sector OS/2 and DOS's <tt>FDISK</tt> programs use.
An operating system which doesn't use or at least understand
this scheme will have problems. The same is true for a user who
doesn't let Disk Manager load before booting off a floppy.
<p>
To install Boot Manager and OS/2 successfully, I found I had to:
<ul>
<li>let the installation program 'do its thing',
<li>leave the primary FAT partition it had created in place, and
<li>install Boot Manager at the <strong>end</strong> of the disk's free space
as a precaution.
</ul>
I suspect that you can later reformat this partition for HPFS if you want
to install OS/2 in a primary partition.
<p>
<strong>Worth Noting:</strong>  DOS will only boot from the first primary
FAT partition on the first disk and will not access other primary partitions
on the same disk (FAT or otherwise).  OS/2 will boot from either a primary
or extended partition.  Like DOS, it will ignore other primary partitions
if it boots from a primary.  For maximum flexibility, install OS/2 in
an extended (logical) partition and reserve the primary partition(s) for
DOS or other uses.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
In general, all of the (minimal) documentation is flawed, and the
installation utility (<tt>DMOS2.EXE</tt>) makes things worse.  Ignore
the docs and make all changes manually, as described below.
<p>
<h3>Preliminaries</h3>
<ul>
<li>Obtain these files via FTP from 'ftp-os2.cdrom.com', 
'software.watson.ibm.com', or other popular OS/2 FTP sites and unzip
them:
<ol>
<li><tt>ATAPI.ZIP</tt>, (contains <tt>IBM1S506.ADD</tt>
and <tt>OS2DASD.DMD</tt>) ..or..
<br><tt>WFP_05.ZIP</tt> (Warp FixPak5, which contains identical files
with January dates)
<li><tt>ONTRAC.ZIP</tt>, (contains <tt>ONTRACK.FLT</tt>)
</ol>
<li>Make a copy of Installation Disk 1.  All modifications described below
will be made to this diskette, not to the original.
<p>
<li>Delete <tt>TEDIT.HLP</tt> from the diskette. Copy or create a
dummy file of less than 512 bytes and name it <tt>TEDIT.HLP</tt>.  Our
purpose here is to free up disk space while avoiding a fatal error later 
when the install program tries to copy this file and can't find it.
<p>
<li>Edit the <tt>CONFIG.SYS</tt> on the diskette and make these changes:
<ol>
<li>on the line <tt>BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD</tt>, add <tt>/V</tt>.  This
parameter (/Verbose) is a confidence-building measure:  during boot-up
<tt>IBM1S506.ADD</tt> will display info on all your IDE adapters and drives,
plus it will acknowledge that Ontrack DM is installed.
<li>insert a line and add <tt>BASEDEV=ONTRACK.FLT</tt>
</ol>
<li>Copy these files to the diskette:
<ol>
<li><tt>IBM1S506.ADD</tt>
<li><tt>OS2DASD.DMD</tt>
<li><tt>ONTRACK.FLT</tt>
</ol>
The <tt>ATAPI.ZIP</tt> package also contains revised IDE CD-ROM drivers;
follow the instructions in the package's <tt>README.TXT</tt> to install them later.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>
Before beginning, think long and hard about the size you want your first
primary partition to be - you may be stuck with it permanently.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the CMOS settings for your new drive are correct
<p>
<li>Boot DOS from a floppy
<p>
<li>Run <tt>DM.EXE</tt>.  When prompted, enter the partition size.
It will also ask for your DOS system diskette so it can run the Format and
Sys commands.
<p>
<li>When complete, remove any floppies and reboot<br>
<strong>Important:</strong>  From now on, you can no longer boot from
a floppy in the conventional fashion if you want Disk Manager to provide
its services.  You must remove all floppies, start the boot sequence, and
wait for DM to prompt <i>Press spacebar to boot from diskette</i>.  You
have 2 seconds to press the spacebar;  you can then insert the diskette
at your leisure and press Enter when ready.
<p>
<li>Insert the OS/2 Installation diskette, press Enter, and proceed as
instructed;  when offered the choice, select Advanced Installation
<p>
<li>The next screen will propose drive C: as the installation partition.
Select option 2 <i>Specify a different drive or partition</i> to run
<tt>FDISK</tt> so you can install Boot Manager and optionally, create a
new partition.
<p>
<li>From Boot Manager's 'Options' menu, choose <i>Install Boot Manager</i>.
When asked whether to place it at the beginning or end of the free space,
choose <strong>End</strong>.
<p>
<li>If you want to install OS/2 in a partition other than C:, select the
line that lists the disk's <i>Free Space</i> and choose
<i>Create Partition</i>.  As noted above, the author suggests using a
logical partition for several reasons - among them, the fact that it
produces a successful installation.
<p>
<li>The remainder of the installation should proceed without problems.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Post Installation</h3>
<p>
Because they are non-standard, the changes described above are not
propagated to your new installation and must be manually reentered:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Copy <tt>ONTRACK.FLT</tt> to the directories <tt>\OS2\BOOT</tt> and
<tt>\OS2\INSTALL\BOOTDISK</tt>.
<p>
<li>Edit the <tt>CONFIG.SYS</tt> in the root directory and make these changes:
<ol>
<li>on the line <tt>BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD</tt>, add <tt>/V /A:0 /U:0 /LBA</tt>.
This tells the system to use Logical Block Addressing for Adapter 0, Unit 0 
(This assumes your new disk is the first drive on the primary IDE adapter,
and that your drive is capable of LBA).
<li>insert a line and add <tt>BASEDEV=ONTRACK.FLT</tt>
</ol>
<li>Copy <tt>TEDIT.HLP</tt> (the real one) from the Installation
diskette (Disk 0) to the directory <tt>\OS2</tt>.
<p>
<li>Breathe a sigh of relief that it all worked, and enjoy your speedy
and capacious new hard drive (e-mail me if it didn't).
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
Most of the procedure above was tested as this was being written to ensure
that my recollections agreed with reality.  However, the steps from
installing Boot Manager onward could not be.  Nonetheless, recollection
and comments in various Usenet postings suggest that the entire procedure
as described is both complete and accurate.
<p>
Other miscellanea:
<ul>
<p>
<li>From what I can gather, HPFS (and NTFS) can handle large disks on
their own without Disk Manager's help.  If you don't plan on any FAT
partitions, you may be able to skip it.
<p>
<li>Some documents state that all bootable partitions must lie within
the first 528MB.  As the above demonstrates, this isn't necessarily
the case if the partition starts below this limit.  How the use of
HPFS vs FAT affects this is unknown to me, as is the case of a partition
that starts above 528MB.
</ul>

<title>Le Partenariat canado-am&eacute;ricain</title>

<h1>Le Partenariat canado-am&eacute;ricain</h1><p>
</center>
<p>
Depuis cent vingt-cinq ans, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis
unissent leurs efforts pour r&eacute;gler leurs probl&egrave;mes
communs et parvenir &agrave; des buts semblables. <p>
<p>
     Ils sont aujourd'hui li&eacute;s par plus de 220
trait&eacute;s et accords relatifs au commerce, aux transports,
&agrave; la p&ecirc;che, &agrave; la faune, au contr&ocirc;le de la
pollution et maintes autres activit&eacute;s.<p>
     <p>
<h2>Commerce</h2>  Le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis
r&eacute;alisent le plus grand volume d'&eacute;changes
enregistr&eacute; au monde et qui s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave;
plus de 334 milliards de dollars CAN (254 milliards de dollars US)
en biens et invisibles pour 1993.<p>
<p>
     L'Accord de libre-&eacute;change (ALE) entre le Canada et les
&Eacute;tats-Unis entr&eacute; en vigueur le ler janvier 1989
&eacute;liminait en 10 ans tous les droits de douane et de
nombreuses barri&egrave;res non tarifaires entre les deux pays. Il
&eacute;tablissait un ensemble de principes quant au commerce des
services, &eacute;largissait les possibilit&eacute;s d'investissement, renfor^ccedil;ait
le Pacte de l'automobile et garantissait aux deux pays leurs
approvisionnements et leurs march&eacute;s de produits &eacute;nerg&eacute;tiques.
L'ALENA, qui a remplac&eacute; l'AL&Eacute;, est entr&eacute; en
vigueur le ler janvier 1994. Le Mexique s'est alors joint au
partenariat canado-am&eacute;ricain, cr&eacute;ant ainsi la plus
importante zone de libre-&eacute;change au monde avec 360 millions de
personnes et une production globale de 6 billions de dollars US.<p>
<p>
<h2>Environnement</h2>  Le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis sont
conjointement responsables de la protection de leur environnement
commun.<p>
<p>
     Nos deux pays g&egrave;rent de concert les ressources
naturelles du continent depuis 1909, date de la signature du Trait&eacute;
des eaux limitrophes en vertu duquel a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute;e la Commission
mixte internationale. L'Accord de 1972 relatif &agrave; la
qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans les Grands Lacs (renouvel&eacute; et
&eacute;largi en 1978 et 1987), a permis de r&eacute;aliser des
progr&egrave;s consid&eacute;rables dans l'assainissement des
Grands Lacs; les deux pays collaborent en vue de pr&eacute;venir
l'apparition de nouvelles sources de pollution dans les Grands
Lacs.
<p>
     En 1991, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont sign&eacute;
l'Accord sur la qualit&eacute; de l'air, aboutissement de dix ans
d'efforts pour trouver une solution au probl&egrave;me des pluies acides.
L'Accord impose un plafond permanent aux &eacute;missions d'anhydrite
sulfureux ainsi que des r&eacute;ductions des &eacute;missions d'oxydes d'azote.
Il oblige les deux pays &agrave; r&eacute;duire les polluants atmosph&eacute;riques qui
traversent la fronti&egrave;re et &eacute;tablit une structure pour
la gestion des futurs probl&egrave;mes de pollution atmosph&eacuterique
transfrontali&egrave;re.
<p>
<h2>D&eacute;fense</h2>  Le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis
jouent un r&ocirc;le essentiel dans leur s&eacute;curit&eacute; r&eacute;ciproque. Fr&egrave;res
d'armes au cours des deux guerres mondiales, nous assumons
conjointement depuis pr&egrave;s de 50 ans la d&eacute;fense de
l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord. En mettant en commun nos ressources
&eacute;conomiques, nous avons constitu&eacute; une infrastructure
industrielle nord-am&eacute;ricaine de d&eacute;fense qui serait au
service de nos forces arm&eacute;es en cas de conflit. Tous deux membres
fondateurs du Trait&eacute; de l'Atlantique Nord (OTAN), nous
sommes en outre associ&eacute;s pour constituer le Commandement de la
d&eacute;fense a&eacute;rospatiale de l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord
(NORAD).<p>
<p>
<h2Tourisme</h2>Les &Eacute;tats-Unis font figure de
destination favorite pour les gens d'affaires et les touristes
canadiens et plus de 12 millions de visiteurs canadiens
franchissent chaque ann&eacute;e la fronti&egrave;re pour au moins
une nuit. Au del&agrave; de 8 millions de r&eacute;sidents des &Eacute;tats-Unis passent
&eacute;galement plus d'une nuit au Canada.<p>

Floppy drive does not recognize when a diskette is replaced
</title>
<h2>
Floppy drive does not recognize when a diskette is replaced
</h2>
Last Updated: 5th December, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Floppy drive does not recognize when a diskette is replaced.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Some floppy diskette drives.
<h2>Problem</h2>

   Some diskette drives provide a signal to indicate that the media
   has changed ("change line").  Normally the IBM1FLPY.ADD driver
   determines this status at startup time, but in some cases it
   appears to be in error.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   First, look at the available options for the IBM1FLPY.ADD driver in
   the Warp Command Reference by typing HELP BASEDEV at a command
   prompt and then selecting the entry for IBM1FLPY.  Don't overlook
   the Examples page.
<p>
   Second, see what the IBM1FLPY driver &lt;thinks&gt; the drive is
   providing by adding a /V (verbose) switch to the driver line in
   CONFIG.SYS and rebooting.  If there is text of the form ...Options:
   CL+..., then the driver thinks that the drive is providing such a
   signal.
<p>
   Finally, to override an incorrect assumption for (say) both
   diskette drives, modify the IBMFLPY line in CONFIG.SYS to look like
   the following:
<p>
<pre>
   BASEDEV=IBM1FLPY.ADD /A:0 /U:0 /CL:NONE /U:1 /CL:NONE
</pre>
<p>
   If you're unclear on these options, go back and check them in the
   Command Reference.
<h2>Notes</h2>
None.

<b>Les flux commerciaux canado-ame&eacute;ricans sont les plus importants au monde.</b>
<p>
</font>
Le volume des biens, des services et des revenus &eacute;chang&eacute;s entre le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis constitue le commerce bilat&eacute;ral le plus important au monde.  En 1993, le commerce des &Eacute;tats-Unis avec le Canada a totalis&eacute

<b>Le Canada est le meilleur march&eacute; d'exportation des &Eacute;tats-Unis.</b>
</font>
<p>
En 1993, le Canada a achet&eacute; des &Eacute;tats-Unis pour 128,1 milliards de &#36; de marchandises et d'invisibles, soit 60 &#37; de plus que le Japon et deux fois plus que le Royaume-Uni.  Il est de fait que les Eacute;tats-Unis ont export&eacute; da

<b>Le Canada ach&egrave;te sa part d services am&eacute;ricains.</b>
</font>
<p>
Les &eacute;changes de services et les autres op&eacute;rations sur invisibles constituent la composante la plus dynamique du commerce mondial.  Les &Eacute;tats-Unis sont le plus grand exportateur mondial de services, qu'il s'agisse de services de transp
orts, de logiciel, de banque et d'architecture, de services financiers ou d'autres comp&eacute;tences.
<p>
Le Canada est l'un des meilleurs client des &Eacute;tats-Unis, leur ayant achet&eacute; pour pr&egrave;s de 27 milliards de &#36; en invisibles en 1993.  Sur ce montant, les services comptaient pour 16,6 milliards de &#36;, et les revenus d'actifs am&eacu
te;ricains au Canada totalisaient 10,3 millard de &#36;.  Le Canada a fourni pour 8,9 milliards de &#36; de services aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, et les revenus d'actifs canadiens  aux &Eacute;tats-Unis repr&eacute;sentaient 4,2 milliards de &#36;. 
<p>
Ces derni&egrave;rres ann&eacute;es, les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement enregistr&eacute; un exc&eacute;dent dans les &eacute;changes de services, et le Canada un exc&eacute;dent au poste des &eacute;changes de marchandises.

INSTALLING WARP, GETTING SYS0045 ON WINDOWS DISK #1
</title>
<h3>
INSTALLING WARP, GETTING SYS0045 ON WINDOWS DISK #1
</h3>
Last updated: 27 Dec 1994
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    Installing OS/ WARP passed the first phase and onto the second
    phase of the installation, when asks to insert the WINDOWS
    DISK #1, will received a " SYS0045 sector can't be found ... "
    If going into OS/2 and DIR on the WINDOWS DISKS, it is ok, but if
    trying to copy, xcopy any files from the WINDOWS DISKS to the
    hardfile, result the same error SYS0045 message.

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    User has changed the floppy drives around and did not update
    the CMOS to reflects the changes.

</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    User must go into the system CMOS and make sure the floppy
    drives are setup correctly.
    Example: If changed the 1.44mb drive from B: to A:, and the 1.2mb
             drive from A: to B:, on the Setup on the CMOS should
             reflect that 1.44mb as an A: drive and 1.2mb as an B:
             drive.

<H2>Allegations of Inappropriate Data Collection in Windows 95</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="ciac.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10> 
Over the last couple of months, allegations have been made in several
Internet newsgroups, that <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</A> was collecting information about a
users files and directories without the users consent. This collection
supposedly occurred when the user registered <I>Win95</I> or connected to the
<I>Microsoft Network (MSN)</I>. Note that we have not detected any unauthorized
transmission of information. In the May 22, 1995 edition of <B><I>Information
Week</I></B> (p. 88), an article in the In Short column on software piracy said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;<I>Microsoft</I> officials confirm that beta versions of
<I>Windows 95</I> include a small viral routine called Registration Wizard. It
interrogates every system on a network gathering intelligence on what software
is being run on which machine. It then creates a complete listing of both <I>Microsoft
</I>'s and competitors' products by machine, which it reports to <I>Microsoft
</I> when customers sign up for Microsoft's Network Services, due for launch
later this year. Customers must actively disable the routine if they don't want
it to run.&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Later posts to some Internet news groups included a copy of the <B><I>Information
Week</I></B> article plus the following:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>&quot;An update on this. A friend of mine got hold of the beta
test CD of <I>Win95</I>, and set up a packet sniffer between his serial port
and the modem. When you try out the free demo time on The <I>Microsoft Network</I>, 
it transmits your entire directory structure in background. ...&quot;</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The official response from <I>Microsoft</I> in the <I>WinNews Electronic
Newsletter</I> (Vol. 2, #8, June 5, 1995 is as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>REDMOND, Washington - May 30, 1995</P>
<P><I>Microsoft</I> today responds to customer confusion with the on-line
registration option of <I>Windows 95</I>. <I>Microsoft</I> reassures customers
the on-line registration feature preserves user privacy. The confusion began
last week when an industry publication incorrectly reported that the on-line
registration option sent information on customers' computer systems to <I>Microsoft</I> 
without consent. This article, and several subsequent posts on the
Internet, alleging the unauthorized query and sending of customer information,
are not accurate. In fact, the on-line registration option is simply an
electronic version of the paper-based registration card that will ship in the
<I>Windows 95</I> product box. Similar to many paper-based registration cards,
on-line registration is completely optional and allows customers to provide
their system information for product support and marketing purposes.</P>
<P>The on-line registration option in <I>Windows 95</I> provides a more
convenient and accurate method for registering than the paper-based card that
comes in the product box. This is because the information is gathered directly
from the local computer rather than requiring the user to guess their system
information, and then type it and send via a separate card.</P>
<P>The on-line registration process uses three steps to register customers.
Customers are asked to provide information such as Customer Name, Company Name,
Address and Phone Number. Customers are then presented the option of providing
information about their computer system's configuration. A screen displays a
list of the computer system's configuration information - such as the processor
type, amount of RAM and hard disk space, and hardware peripherals such as
network card, CD-ROM drive, and sound card. This information is gathered by the
registration program which queries the system registry of the local computer.
Customers must review and explicitly choose to provide the information or it is
not sent. Customers are then presented with a list of application programs that
reside on the local computer and asked if they would like to provide this
information as well. The list of products is gathered by the registration
program which looks for a list of programs on the local hard disk. The user must
again explicitly choose to provide this information as part of the registration
process or it is not sent.</P>
<P>Once the user chooses to send the information, the registration process is
completed by sending the registration information to <I>Microsoft</I>. On-line
registration uses the transport of the <I>Microsoft Network</I> to send the
information. The customer does not have to be a <I>Microsoft Network</I>
subscriber to register on-line, and once registered, the customer is not a <I>Microsoft
Network</I> subscriber. Registering <I>Windows 95</I> is a separate process
from signing up for the <I>Microsoft Network</I>. Contrary to reports, the
on-line registration feature does not query serial numbers or product
registration information designed to fight software piracy. It also does not
query computers on the local or wide-area network. For a list of the exact
information gathered by on-line registration, the user can view the <B>REGINFO.TXT</B> 
file found in the <B>C:\WINDOWS</B> directory of the local computer.</P>
<P>The on-line registration feature of <I>Windows 95</I> is an option for
customers that makes registering <I>Windows 95</I> more accurate and
convenient. Providing computer specific configuration information is strictly up
to the customer. The registration information helps <I>Microsoft</I> build
better products, as well as offer customers better information on their programs
and better product support.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To check these allegations, CIAC built a serial packet sniffer to examine
the message traffic between <I>Win95</I> and <I>Microsoft</I>. Using this
sniffer and the released version of Win 95, we examined the message traffic
during <I>Win95</I> registration, MSN registration, and MSN use. At no time did
we see any unauthorized transmission of information. Everything we saw supported
the claims in <I>Microsoft</I>'s response.</P>
<P>During the <I>Win95</I> product registration, the Registration Wizard does
collect information about your hardware and software, but it asks you if it can
send that information to <I>Microsoft</I> before actually doing so. If you
answer No, the information is not sent. The information actually sent to <I>Microsoft</I> 
during registration of the <I>Win95</I> product is contained in the file
<B>reginfo.txt</B> in the windows directory. Examine this file after completing
the registration process to see what information was sent to <I>Microsoft</I>.</P>
<P>During registration and use of the MSN network, nothing suspicious was sent
to <I>Microsoft</I>. We did note, that the credit card number you must specify
to pay for your connection to MSN is sent in the clear. However, you should
realize that this is no more risky than giving your credit card number over the
phone to any other company whose products you want to buy.</P>
<P>Many applications register themselves over the network whenever you start
them up, so the risk is there that an application running on a networked machine
could send inappropriately obtained information to some other site. While this
could be done, it is unlikely that a large company would take the risk, because
the damage to a company's reputation (not to mention legal action) would be
severe.</P>

<title>Swapping the A and B Drives</title>
<h2>Swapping the A: and B: Drives</h2>
Last Updated: 30th December, 1994
<hr>
To change your "B" drive (3.5") to become your "A" drive, you MUST follow 
these steps:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off and then open up your computer.
<p>
<li> Examine the ribbon cable running from your floppy controller to your floppy drives.  
<p>
You will (hopefully) notice four connectors on one end.  Two will be for
the 3.5" drive and two will be for the 5.25" drive.  You will also
notice that the cable has a twist in it between the connectors.  The two
connectors closest to the controller card and before the twist are the
connectors for the "B" drive.  The two connectors after that twist are
the connectors for the "A" drive.  That twist is how the drives know
which one is wanted ("A" or "B").  
<p>
What you now have to do, is take the
3.5" "A" connector and install it on the 3.5" drive and then install the
5.25" "B" connector on the 5.25" drive(remembering to observe correct
polarity of course(pin 1 goes to pin 1 and all that)).  
<p>
If, when you
open your computer, your ribbon cable does not include the correct
number of connectors, then you either have to forget about changing your
floppy drives around or you have to go purchase a cable with the correct
number of connectors.  Most older systems will probably have only a
5.25" "A" connector rather than both a 5.25" and 3.5" connector.
<p>
<li>Change your bios settings so that your 3.5" drive is listed as your "A" 
drive and your 5.25" drive is your "B" drive.
<p>
<li>Reboot and verify correct operation of your new "A" and "B" drives.
<p>
<li>Turn off and then close back up your computer.  You are now ready to enjoy 
your modified system.

&lt;&lt;The Spirit<br>
of Haida Gwaii&gt;&gt;
</font>
<br>
<font size=5>
par Bill Reid
</font>

<br clear=all>

<p>
Il y a peut-&ecirc;tre un million de Canadiens dont les anc&ecirc;tres ou,
&agrave; tout le moins, certains des anc&ecirc;tres &eacute;taient
membres des premi&egrave;res nations--c'est-&agrave;-dire des peuples qui
vivaient en Am&eacute;rique du Nord avant la venue de Leif Ericsson, Christophe
Colomb ou Jacques Cartier. Mais sur le plan tant intellectuel que spirituel et
mat&eacute;riel, tous les Canadiens sont redevables aux peuples autochtones et
&agrave; leurs cultures.<p>
<p>
     Parmi ces nombreux peuples, nous retrouvons les baleiniers et les
p&ecirc;cheurs inuit de l'Arctique; les agriculteurs outaouais et iroquois des
Grands Lacs; les chasseurs cris et chipewyans des for&ecirc;ts du nord; ainsi que
les nombreuses collectivit&eacute;s villageoises s&eacute;dentaires de
p&ecirc;cheurs, de chasseurs et de commer&ccedil;ants de la c&ocirc;te nord-
ouest.<p>
<p>
     Les Haida comptent parmi les premi&egrave;res nations du Canada. Leur
territoire ancestral - les &icirc;les de la Reine-Charlotte sur les cartes
modernes, au large des c&ocirc;tes de la Colombie-Britannique - est aujourd'hui appel&eacute;
les Iles du Peuple, Haida Gwaii, par la plupart de ses habitants.
<p>
     Des si&egrave;cles avant que les Europ&eacute;ens n'atteignent la
c&ocirc;te ouest de l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord, les Haida construisaient au bord
de la mer des villages constitu&eacute;s de grandes maisons carr&eacute;es en bois, devant
lesquelles ils plantaient leur m&acirc;t tot&eacute;mique. Insulaires, p&ecirc;cheurs et
commer&ccedil;ants, les Haida &eacute;taient aussi tr&egrave;s habiles dans la
fabrication et le maniement de grands cano&euml;s monoxyles pouvant affronter la mer.
<p>
     L'artiste haida Bill Reid, n&eacute; en 1920, a lui-m&ecirc;me
creus&eacute; plusieurs de ces cano&euml;s traditionnels; il a aussi sculpt&eacute; quelques-
uns des plus beaux exemples de totems du XXe si&egrave;cle et a construit plusieurs
maisons haida traditionnelles. Tout au long de sa carri&egrave;re Reid s'est &eacute;galement
servi des techniques et des outils europ&eacute;ens pour r&eacute;aliser des oeuvres en or, en
argent, en buis et en d'autres mat&eacute;riaux. Son oeuvre transcende les fronti&egrave;res
culturelles et compte des pi&egrave;ces de format r&eacute;duit aussi bien que
des pi&egrave;ces monumentales. L'ambassade du Canada &agrave; Washington est
fi&egrave;re d'accueillir la sculpture la plus grande et la plus complexe
r&eacute;alis&eacute;e par Reid: un cano&euml; haida transportant treize
personnages, moul&eacute; en bronze. Cette oeuvre imposante, v&eacute;ritable
pi&egrave;ce d'orf&egrave;vrerie architecturale, est longue de six m&egrave;tres
(20 pieds), haute de pr&egrave;s de quatre m&egravetres (13 pieds) et p&egrave;se environ 5 000
kilogrammes (11 000 livres). Elle a &eacute;t&eacute; achev&eacute;e en 1991,
apr&egrave;s cinq ans de travail. Reid l'a intitul&eacute;e <i>The Spirit of
Haida Gwaii.<p>
<p>
     </i>La mythologie haida est riche et complexe, comme celles de la
Gr&egrave;ce antique et du Mexique pr&eacute;colombien. Beaucoup d'ouvrages ont
&eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;dig&eacute;s sur le sujet et bien des universitaires
en ont fait le champ d'&eacute;tude de toute une vie. Mais comme la sculpture de Reid
le prouve, cette mythologie n'appartient pas uniquement au domaine
litt&eacute;raire ou &agrave; l'histoire culturelle. Les passagers du cano&euml;
et leurs rapports entre eux sont autant de r&eacute;f&eacute;rences historiques et l&eacute;gendaires.
<p>
     &Agrave; la poupe, tenant le gouvemail, le Corbeau, le filou de la
c&ocirc;te nord-ouest, acteur principal de bien des histoires haida.
Ramass&eacute;e sous sa queue, la Femme Souris, guide traditionnel et
 conseilli&egrave;re de ceux qui voyagent entre le monde des humains et l'univers des
mythes haida.<p>
<p>
     &Agrave; l'avant de l'embarcation, mais tourn&eacute; vers
l'arri&egrave;re, se tient l'Ours Grizzli. Pr&egrave;s de lui, regardant vers la
proue et pagayant du c&ocirc;t&eacute; b&acirc;bord, sa femme humaine, la M&egrave;re Ours. Les histoires
de mariages entre une femme et un ours, tout comme celles dont le h&eacute;ros est le
Corbeau, ne sont pas propres &agrave; Haida Gwaii; elles se retrouvent dans
presque toutes les collectivit&eacute;s autochtones de la r&eacute;gion
subarctique canadienne et de la c&ocirc;te nord-ouest. Entre l'Ours et sa femme
on peut voir deux autres personnages importants de ces his-toires: leurs enfants,
les deux oursons. Reid les appelle le Gentil Ourson et le M&eacute;chant Ourson,
non pas en r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; la mythologie haida, mais comme rappel d'une comptine pour
enfants de A. A. Milne. (On peut facilement les diff&eacute;rencier: les oreilles
du M&eacute;chant Ourson pointent vers l'arri&egrave;re, celles du Gentil Ourson pointent vers
l'avant.)<p>
<p>
     Vient ensuite le Castor, derri&egrave;re la M&egrave;re Ours. Aujourd'hui,
c'est un embl&egrave;me du Canada, mais dans la mythologie haida, il est l'un des oncles
du Corbeau et, dans les premiers temps de la terre, il vivait au fond de l'oc&eacute;an
o&ugrave; il amassait toute l'eau douce et tout le poisson du monde.
Derri&egrave;re lui, la Femme Requin, cr&eacute;ature mi-humaine, mi-requin qui
poss&egrave;de le don de modifier son apparence.<p>
<p>
     En face de la M&egrave;re Ours, &agrave; tribord, l'Aigle. Au-dessous, sur
le plat-bord, la Grenouille. Au milieu, dans une position arqu&eacute;e, le Loup,
qui enfonce ses griffes dans le dos du Castor et ses dents dans une aile de
l'Aigle. Derri&egrave;re les &eacute;paules du Loup et sous la t&ecirc;te massive
du Corbeau, un pagayeur humain que Reid appelle l'Ancien Conscrit Forc&eacute;. Se
tenant au centre de cette m&eacute;nagerie, un autre humain, le chaman, le chef,
que les haida appellent Kilstlaai. La robe qu'il porte et le b&acirc;ton qu'il tient
&agrave; la main -sculpture dans une sculpture, qui repr&eacute;sente le Phoque,
le Corbeau et l'&eacute;paulard - sont autant de renvois &agrave; d'autres histoires qui
expliquent la vision haida du monde.<p>
<p>
     En plus de leur importance dans la mythologie haida, beaucoup de ces
personnages jouent un r&ocirc;le capital dans le corpus h&eacute;raldique haida.
Ainsi, le Corbeau et l'Aigle sont les embl&egrave;mes de chacune des deux moiti&eacute;s de la
soci&eacute;t&eacute; haida. Le Loup est l'embl&egrave;me de la famille ou du
clan de Reid lui-m&ecirc;me, le Qqaadasghu Qiighawaai, qui se rattache &agrave; la moiti&eacute; du
Corbeau.<p>
<p>
     Les &eacute;l&eacute;ments sculpt&eacute;s sur les totems haida sont sou-
vent choisis pour leur valeur mythologique, ou pour leur valeur h&eactute;raldique. Sur
certains totems, ils rev&ecirc;tent ces deux valeurs &agrave; la fois. On retrouve dans la
sculpture <i>The Spirit of Haida Gwaii </i>le m&ecirc;me enchev&ecirc;trement
complexe de symboles mythologiques et sociaux.
<p>
     Le cano&euml; transporte le Corbeau et l'Aigle, des femmes et des hommes,
un homme riche et un homme pauvre, des animaux aussi bien que des &ecirc;tres humains. 
Ne pourrait-on pas y voir la repr&eacute;sentation non pas d'une seule culture,
mais de toute la famille des &ecirc;tres vivants? Tout n'est pas harmonie et f&eacutelicit&eacute;
dans cette embarcation.  Certains visages prennent une expression crisp&eactue;e, et on
sent les tensions. Mais au-del&agrave; de leurs diff&eacute;rences, tous pagaient ensemble,
dans une m&ecirc;me embarcation, dans une m&ecirc;me direction. Peu importe le but de leur
voyage, souhaitons leur bonne chance.
<p>
<i>Le gouvernement du Canada remercie sinc&egrave;rement la
soci&eacute;t&eacute; Nabisco BrandsLt&eacute;e d'avoir g&eacute;nereusement
fait don au peuple canadien de l'ouevre de Bill Reid intitul&eacute;</i> The Spirit of
Haida Gwaii.<p>

 ERROR DESCRIPTION:
 Summary of Problem:  WARP fails to install (to e:) from CDROM
 on a system in which 2.11 installed from CDROM fine (on d:
 using the same settings).  The Driver BTSCSI.ADD is hanging the
 system shortly after accessing the CDROM.
 .
 ****** General Hardware/Software Configuration ******
 OS/2 Version:                      WARP 3.0
 Service Level:                     GA

 File System:                       FAT
 Floppy A: Disk Drive Size:         3.5
 .
 Additional information as follows:
 While OS2 2.11 works and installs from CDROM fine, replacing
 the Warp driver with the 2.11 does not repair the problem.
 .
 SCSI Bus is properly terminated, and the CDROM and HARDDRIVE
 are the only things on it.
 CDROM fails at x4 speed and single and is a SCSI-2 which works
 under 2.11.
 .
 Buslogic CARD specs:
 Bios 4.84
 Firmaware 4.21
 Set for INT#c level triggered
 .
 Buslogic has been contacted.
 
 
 LOCAL FIX:
 The hang is being caused by the Buslogic adapter not being
 configured correctly. Please not that although this adapter may
 have worked under 2.11, it may still not be configured
 correctly as WARP is fully PCI enabled, while 2.11 was not.
 .
 The problem caused by the adapter which is not a fully PCI 2.0
 compliant (this is true of all revisions earilier than "c").
 What needs to be done is setting the INT pin(a,b,c,d)for the
 slot to the match on the mother board, this may be different
 for every mother board.  On intel mother boards it is typically
 Slot#1 INTA, Slot#2 INTB, Slot#3 INTC, Slot#4 INTD. On an Opti
 mother board the situation is the same but the card in slot two
 had to be set to int#a even though slot#2 was int#b on the
 mother board.
 .
 Both the mother board, and the adapter need to be set.
 Customers should be refered to Buslogic for further assistance
 configuring these adapters.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<img src="../images/new.gif">T. Conley (tconley@texas.net) writes (6th August, 1995):
<p>
Just a note concerning the BUSLOGIC BT946C PCI SCSI Controller.
I am using it with no problems (almost) I am also using a Plextor PX63CS
internal 6X CD-ROM. 
<p>
My only trial was that the install was a bit strange with a couple of extra 
boots but it finally got under way and I think used a 4X driver from Plextor
for my drive. 
<p>
I got the system from MICRON and it works very nice with OS2 Warp. (Pent 133)
Anyhow just thought I'd pass the info along.

<h2>NOTES POUR UNE ALLOCUTION PRONONC&Eacute;E PAR RAYMOND CHR&Eacute;TIEN,<br>
AMBASSADEUR DU CANADA AUX &Eacute;TATS-UNIS<br>

DEVANT LES MEMBRES DU CANADIAN CLUB OF TORONTO</h2>

<h3>POINT DE VUE D'UN CANADIEN &Agrave; WASHINGTON
SUR LES RAPPORTS CANADO-AM&Eacute;RICAINS
</h3>

<h4>Toronto, le 10 mai 1995</h4>
</center>

<hr>
<p>

Monsieur Phillips, Ambassadeur Blanchard, Consul g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Kennedy,
Mesdames et Messieurs,<p>

Je vous remercie de votre aimable pr&eacute;sentation.<p>

J'ai eu l'occasion d'exposer dans de nombreuses villes am&eacute;ricaines les 
principes que d&eacute;fend
le Canada, mais je prononce ici mon premier discours devant un auditoire canadien 
depuis mon
d&eacute;part pour Washington.<p>

Je me propose de d&eacute;velopper avec vous deux aspects importants de nos 
relations avec les
&Eacute;tats-Unis. Je vous parlerai donc :<p>

<ol>

<li>de ce qui se passe &agrave; Washington et de ce que cela signifie pour le Canada, 
et
&eacute;galement<p>

<li>de nos rapports avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis et de la fa&ccedil;on dont ces rapports 
vont
probablement &eacute;voluer au fur et &agrave; mesure que nous approchons de l'an 
2000.
</ol>
<p>

<h3>Que se passe-t-il &agrave; Washington?</h3>


Les D&eacute;mocrates ont perdu le pouvoir au profit des R&eacute;publicains. Avec 
le 104e
Congr&egrave;s, il s'est &eacute;tabli une toute nouvelle dynamique entre la Maison 
blanche et le Congr&egrave;s. Le
pr&eacute;sident de la Chambre des repr&eacute;sentants, Newt Gingrich, m&egrave;ne le 
bal sur la sc&egrave;ne politique et le
pr&eacute;sident Clinton fait des pieds et des mains pour reprendre les r&ecirc;nes. 
Depuis leur &eacute;lection, les
R&eacute;publicains remettent en question diff&eacute;rents principes qui 
&eacute;taient &agrave; l'honneur depuis pr&egrave;s de
soixante ans, c'est-&agrave;-dire depuis le New deal. Ils soutiennent que les 
politiques interventionnistes
de l'&Eacute;tat ont &eacute;chou&eacute; et ce message trouve &eacute;cho dans toutes 
les couches de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; politique
am&eacute;ricaine. Ce qui est moins clair, c'est ce qu'en pense monsieur tout le 
monde. Il semble que
l'&eacute;lecteur moyen soit bien d'accord pour que l'on fasse des coupures, en autant 
que ce soit dans le
portefeuille du voisin et non pas dans le sien.<p>

Lorsque nous examinons ce qui se passe au Congr&egrave;s, nous nous attachons 
&agrave;
d&eacute;celer les changements qui peuvent se r&eacute;percuter sur le Canada. 
Permettez moi de vous en
signaler quelques-uns.<p>

En mati&egrave;re de politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re, le Congr&egrave;s 
am&eacute;ricain se montre de plus en plus
isolationniste et unilat&eacute;raliste, ce qui est tout &agrave; fait contraire 
&agrave; nos int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts. Nous, Canadiens,
sommes des internationalistes et des multilat&eacute;ralistes convaincus. Nous 
appartenons &agrave; presque
toutes les grandes institutions mondiales. Nous savons, par exp&eacute;rience, que 
c'est par le
multilat&eacute;ralisme que nous pouvons maximiser notre influence dans le monde.<p>

Permettez-moi de vous faire part de deux exemples inqui&eacute;tants.<p>

Le premier a trait au r&ocirc;le des Nations Unies, et plus particuli&egrave;rement 
&agrave; l'utilisation des
forces de maintien de la paix pour favoriser la s&eacute;curit&eacute; et la 
stabilit&eacute; dans le monde. Le Canada est
convaincu de l'utilit&eacute; de ces institutions. Mais &agrave; Washington, on pense 
bien diff&eacute;remment. Dans
certains milieux, l'ONU et certains de ses programmes suscitent une animosit&eacute; 
presque palpable.<p>

Cuba est un autre exemple illustrant cette tendance inqui&eacute;tante. Plus 
t&ocirc;t cette ann&eacute;e, le
s&eacute;nateur Helms et le repr&eacute;sentant Burton ont d&eacute;pos&eacute; un 
projet de loi visant &agrave; prolonger l'embargo
des &Eacute;tats-Unis sur Cuba. Le projet de loi pr&eacute;voit notamment le 
boycottage des produits de pays
qui ont des &eacute;changes commerciaux avec Cuba. Le Canada est un de ces pays. 
Pourtant, l'objectif
vis&eacute; par le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis est le m&ecirc;me : il s'agit de 
favoriser une d&eacute;mocratisation
pacifique de Cuba et de restaurer les droits de la personne dans ce pays.<p>

Ce n'est pas cet objectif que nous mettons en cause. C'est le fait que ce projet de 
loi
d&eacute;termine, &agrave; toute fin pratique, ce que les Canadiens peuvent et ne 
peuvent pas faire au Canada.
C'est la port&eacute;e extraterritoriale du projet de loi qui a suscit&eacute; de 
vives protestations de notre part,
comme, du reste, de la part des pays de l'Union europ&eacute;enne. Je suis heureux de 
pouvoir dire que
l'administration am&eacute;ricaine partage bon nombre de nos pr&eacute;occupations.<p>

Un autre changement important s'est op&eacute;r&eacute; au Congr&egrave;s au 
chapitre des &eacute;changes
commerciaux.<p>

Si, id&eacute;ologiquement, les R&eacute;publicains sont partisans de la 
lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes, le
nouveau Congr&egrave;s se montre bien prudent. La crise mexicaine a refroidi ses 
ardeurs! Et plus les
doutes quant &agrave; la situation financi&egrave;re du Mexique persisteront, moins le 
Congr&egrave;s sera favorable &agrave;
l'adoption de nouvelles mesures de lib&eacute;ralisation du commerce, ce qui comprend 
l'accession du
Chili &agrave; l'ALENA.<p>

Pour ce qui est des questions touchant aux &eacute;changes bilat&eacute;raux (par 
exemple, le bl&eacute;, les
produits laitiers, la volaille, le sucre), les R&eacute;publicains peuvent &ecirc;tre 
aussi chauvins que les
D&eacute;mocrates. Il ne fait absolument aucun doute que certaines de nos politiques, 
notamment celles
qui visent &agrave; appuyer nos industries culturelles, sont pass&eacute;es au peigne 
fin.<p>

Le nouveau Congr&egrave;s et la protection de notre environnement commun. 
&Agrave; l'heure actuelle, le mouvement qui existe aux &Eacute;tats-Unis pour 
r&eacute;duire l'intervention
gouvernementale et d&eacute;centraliser les responsabilit&eacute;s vers les 
&Eacute;tats pourrait nuire &agrave; nos int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts
dans le secteur de l'environnement. Pour r&eacute;pondre aux attentes des indust
riels, 
des l&eacute;gislateurs
vont essayer de limiter la port&eacute;e des lois dites Clean Air Act et Clean Water 
Act. Mes coll&egrave;gues et
moi-m&ecirc;me allons &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s occup&eacute;s &agrave; leur rappeler les 
obligations des &Eacute;tats-Unis &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du
Canada.<p>

&Agrave; cause de l'importance nouvellement acquise par la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation 
de l'Alaska au Congr&egrave;s, il
est malheureusement beaucoup plus probable maintenant qu'on l&egrave;ve l'interdiction 
sur la
prospection &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique dans certaines r&eacute;gions 
frontali&egrave;res. Cela pourrait avoir des r&eacute;percussions
sur la R&eacute;serve nationale de la faune de l'Arctique. Le Canada continue d'avoir 
tr&egrave;s &agrave; coeur la
protection de cette r&eacute;gion de l'Arctique et de ses magnifiques troupeaux de 
caribous.<p>

Il y a un autre facteur qui complique les choses &agrave; Washington. La campagne en 
vue des
&eacute;lections pr&eacute;sidentielles de 1996 a d&eacute;j&agrave; commenc&eacute;. 
&Agrave; l'heure actuelle &agrave; Washington, toutes les
d&eacute;cisions importantes se prennent en fonction des &eacute;lections de novembre 
1996.<p>

<h3>Les relations Canada-&Eacute;tats-Unis : bilan et perspectives</h3>

Je voudrais maintenant vous donner quelques exemples qui montrent pourquoi les liens
qui existent entre le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis sont parmi les plus 
&eacute;troits qui puissent exister entre
deux pays.<p>

Voyons d'abord l'aspect g&eacute;ographique. Nous sommes voisins et amis, et nous 
n'avons pas
de cl&ocirc;ture entre nos propri&eacute;t&eacute;s. Plus de 100 millions de Canadiens 
et d'Am&eacute;ricains franchissent la
fronti&egrave;re chaque ann&eacute;e. Nos deux pays doivent ensemble g&eacute;rer 40 % 
des r&eacute;serves mondiales d'eau
douce. C'est pour cette raison qu'il est si important de prot&eacute;ger les Grands 
Lacs.<p>

Penchons-nous maintenant sur la question du commerce bilat&eacute;ral, pierre 
angulaire de notre
relation. Bon nombre des quelque 230 ententes r&eacute;gissant les relations entre nos 
deux pays portent
sur les &eacute;changes commerciaux. L'accord le plus r&eacute;cent &agrave; cet 
&eacute;gard est l'accord sur l'ouverture des
espaces a&eacute;riens, qui s'est d&eacute;j&agrave; traduit par une 
am&eacute;lioration des services a&eacute;riens entre nos deux
pays. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; cet accord, nous serons mieux en mesure d'am&eacute;liorer 
nos relations commerciales. Je
vous rappelle que les chiffres sur nos &eacute;changes commerciaux avec les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis sont tout &agrave; fait
stup&eacute;fiants.<p>

<ol>
<li>En 1994, le commerce bilat&eacute;ral des biens et marchandises d&eacute;passait 
400 milliards de
dollars, ce qui repr&eacute;sente plus d'un milliard de dollars par jour, tous les 
jours.<p>

<li>Plus de 80 % de nos exportations sont destin&eacute;es aux &Eacute;tats-Unis et 25 
% des exportations
des &Eacute;tats-Unis sont destin&eacute;es au Canada.<p>

<li>Et, fait tout aussi important, les &eacute;changes commerciaux progressent &agrave; 
un rythme
ph&eacute;nom&eacute;nal. Chaque semaine en 1994, les &eacute;changes commerciaux 
repr&eacute;sentaient 900 millions de
dollars de plus qu'en 1993. &Agrave; lui seul, le montant de cette augmentation est 
sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; la valeur
globale de nos &eacute;changes en 1994 avec les autres pays de l'OCDE.<p>

<li>Cette croissance a profit&eacute; &agrave; toutes les provinces, mais plus 
particuli&egrave;rement &agrave; l'Ontario. Au
cours de la derni&egrave;re ann&eacute;e, les exportations de l'Ontario vers les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis ont progress&eacute; &agrave; un
rythme sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; la moyenne nationale. Par exemple, l'Ontario exporte 
davantage de voitures et
de camions aux &Eacute;tats-Unis que le Japon. Et l'Ontario se classe tout de suite en 
deuxi&egrave;me place,
derri&egrave;re le Michigan, pour la construction de voitures en Am&eacute;rique du 
Nord.<p>

<li>Nos &eacute;changes commerciaux avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis rev&ecirc;tent une 
importance cruciale, car ils
nous aideront &agrave; accro&icirc;tre l'emploi et &agrave; obtenir la croissance 
n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; la r&eacute;duction de notre
d&eacute;ficit. Au Canada, 2 millions d'emplois d&eacute;pendent directement de nos 
&eacute;changes avec les
&Eacute;tats-Unis. &Agrave; l'heure actuelle, nos exportations repr&eacute;sentent 
pr&egrave;s de 30 % de notre PIB et ce
pourcentage devrait aller en augmentant dans les ann&eacute;es &agrave; venir.<p>

<li>Bien entendu, des &eacute;changes commerciaux d'une telle envergure ne peuvent se 
faire sans
qu'il y ait occasionnellement des diff&eacute;rends. Mais permettez-moi de vous dire 
ceci : nous sommes
en bien meilleure posture en ce moment que nous ne l'&eacute;tions il y a un an 
seulement. De v&eacute;ritables
progr&egrave;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; faits dans les dossiers du bl&eacute;, du bois 
r&eacute;sineux et de la bi&egrave;re. Il reste encore du
chemin &agrave; faire dans ceux de l'acier, du sucre, des produits laitiers, de la 
volaille et des industries
culturelles, mais je suis convaincu que nous allons en venir &agrave; une solution 
mutuellement
satisfaisante.
</ol>
<p>
J'aborderai maintenant la question de notre partenariat dans les domaines de la 
politique
&eacute;trang&egrave;re, de la d&eacute;fense et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute;.<p>

Nos deux pays ont particip&eacute; &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation des Nations Unies et 
nous devons unir nos
efforts pour rendre cet organisme plus efficace. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; notre 
partenariat au sein du NORAD,
nous assurons conjointement la d&eacute;fense du continent nord-am&eacute;ricain 
depuis plus de 35 ans. Et
gr&acirc;ce &agrave; notre collaboration au sein de l'OTAN et de l'OSCE, nous avons 
contribu&eacute; &agrave; mettre fin &agrave;
la Guerre froide. En outre, le  Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis travaillent ensemble, 
par l'interm&eacute;diaire de
l'Organisation des &Eacute;tats am&eacute;ricains, pour promouvoir la 
d&eacute;mocratie en Am&eacute;rique centrale et en
Am&eacute;rique du Sud. Un tr&egrave;s bon exemple est celui de Ha&iuml;ti o&ugrave;, 
en ce moment m&ecirc;me, des policiers
canadiens et 600 casques bleus sont sur place pour soutenir le processus de 
d&eacute;mocratisation. <p>

Notre dialogue et notre collaboration s'&eacute;tendent &agrave; de nombreux autres 
secteurs : comment
restaurer la paix dans l'ancienne Yougoslavie, comment aider les &Eacute;tats de 
l'ancienne Union
sovi&eacute;tique &agrave; d&eacute;mocratiser leurs institutions et &agrave; 
d&eacute;velopper une &eacute;conomie de march&eacute;, comment
contr&ocirc;ler les armes de destruction massive, comment r&eacute;tablir la paix au 
Moyen-Orient, etc.<p>

Le sommet &eacute;conomique du G-7 pr&eacute;sente un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t plus 
imm&eacute;diat : dans quelques
semaines seulement, l'attention du monde entier se portera sur Halifax. Il y a des 
questions &agrave;
l'ordre du jour qui rev&ecirc;tent une importance capitale pour l'ensemble des pays du 
monde. Une des
questions qui fera l'objet d'une attention particuli&egrave;re est la suivante : la 
n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de r&eacute;former les
institutions financi&egrave;res internationales. Cela englobe l'am&eacute;lioration du 
syst&egrave;me de pr&eacute;-alerte,
l'am&eacute;lioration de la surveillance exerc&eacute;e par le FMI et 
l'&eacute;tablissement d'un m&eacute;canisme applicable
en cas de crise financi&egrave;re.<p>

Bref, nous avons une excellente relation avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis.<p>

Je voudrais maintenant prendre quelques minutes pour vous donner mon avis sur la
direction dans laquelle cette relation extraordinaire va &eacute;voluer et sur ce 
qu'il en sera en l'an 2000.<p>

Tout d'abord, j'ai de fortes pr&eacute;somptions que nos &eacute;changes commerciaux 
avec les
&Eacute;tats-Unis seront plus importants que ne le montrent les statistiques 
impressionnantes dont je
vous ai fait part. L'ALE et l'ALENA ont donn&eacute; le ton et le processus est 
irr&eacute;versible. Nos
&eacute;conomies seront encore plus &eacute;troitement li&eacute;es &agrave; l'avenir.
<p>
Deux statistiques sur l'&eacute;conomie am&eacute;ricaine me convainquent que le 
Canada va
immanquablement profiter de ces bonnes relations &eacute;conomiques avec les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis.
Premi&egrave;rement, 16 % seulement de la main-d'oeuvre am&eacute;ricaine travaille 
actuellement dans le
secteur de la fabrication. Deuxi&egrave;mement, 38 % des marchandises export&eacute;es 
par les &Eacute;tats-Unis
sont des produits de haute technologie. Ce que ces deux chiffres me disent, c'est que 
l'&eacute;conomie
am&eacute;ricaine est d&eacute;j&agrave; pass&eacute;e &agrave; l'&egrave;re de 
l'information. Et c'est pour cette raison que, de tous les pays
industrialis&eacute;s, les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont sans aucune doute le march&eacute; le 
plus dynamique et le plus
comp&eacute;titif. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; notre acc&egrave;s privil&eacute;gi&eacute; 
&agrave; ce march&eacute; et &agrave; notre tr&egrave;s fort partenariat avec les
&Eacute;tats-Unis, je ne vois pas pourquoi notre part du march&eacute; 
am&eacute;ricain, qui est actuellement de 2,2 %
seulement, ne doublerait pas au d&eacute;but du prochain si&egrave;cle. Pensez aux 
centaines de milliers
d'emplois, et donc &agrave; l'accroissement du bien-&ecirc;tre &eacute;conomique, que 
cela pourrait repr&eacute;senter pour
les Canadiens.<p>

Les gouvernements peuvent am&eacute;liorer le climat dans lequel se font chaque 
jour des milliers
d'op&eacute;rations financi&egrave;res en Am&eacute;rique du Nord. Mais c'est vous, 
les membres du milieu des
affaires, qui &ecirc;tes le moteur de l'int&eacute;gration des march&eacute;s et qui 
cr&eacute;ez des emplois et de la richesse.
De notre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, nous pouvons faire davantage pour vous aider &agrave; 
accro&icirc;tre nos &eacute;changes
commerciaux avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis et avec les autres pays du monde. Je vous 
soumets quelques
exemples.<p>

<ol>
<li>En Am&eacute;rique du Nord, nous allons devoir trouver de meilleures fa&ccedil;ons 
pour faire
appliquer les lois commerciales parmi les pays membres de l'ALENA. Le recours &agrave; 
des droits
compensateurs et antidumping en Am&eacute;rique du Nord a cr&eacute;&eacute; un climat 
d'incertitude. Notre objectif
est de trouver des solutions &agrave; ce probl&egrave;me et de les proposer aux trois 
gouvernements concern&eacute;s
d'ici la fin de l'ann&eacute;e.<p>

<li>Dans une perspective mondiale, nous devons, en collaboration avec les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis,
promouvoir la lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes. Les participants au Sommet de 
Miami, en d&eacute;cembre
dernier, se sont entendus pour mettre au point, d'ici l'an 2005, un accord de 
libre-&eacute;change entre
tous les pays du continent am&eacute;ricain. Les membres de l'APEC ont fait part de 
leur intention
d'entreprendre des n&eacute;gociations en vue de faire de la r&eacute;gion du 
Pacifique une zone franche d'ici
l'an 2020. Pourquoi n'irions-nous pas plus loin? Nous avons d&eacute;j&agrave; 
lanc&eacute; l'id&eacute;e d'une entente de
libre-&eacute;change entre l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord et l'Europe. C'est une 
id&eacute;e qui pourrait se concr&eacute;tiser plus
rapidement qu'on ne le pense.
</ol>
<p>

Je sais que certains d'entre vous se demandent si cette tr&egrave;s grande 
interd&eacute;pendance entre
nos deux pays est saine. Est-il bon pour le Canada d'&ecirc;tre engag&eacute; dans une 
relation aussi exclusive,
toute cordiale soit-elle. Est-ce que cette relation pourrait entra&icirc;ner une perte 
d'autonomie
politique ou l'&eacute;rosion de notre souverainet&eacute;?<p>

Je ne le pense pas, et voici pourquoi. &Agrave; l'aube du XXIe si&egrave;cle, il est 
&eacute;vident que tout
nouveau d&eacute;veloppement dans les domaines de la technologie et des 
&eacute;changes commerciaux r&eacute;duit
les dimensions de notre monde. La diffusion de l'information est en train de 
transformer la
configuration politique et &eacute;conomique du monde. Bien que nos liens avec 
l'Europe continuent
d'&ecirc;tre importants, il ne fait aucun doute que nous nous tournons de plus en plus 
vers l'Asie et
l'Am&eacute;rique latine. Et c'est exactement ce que fait Ottawa. Mais quelle que soit 
l'issue de la
r&eacute;organisation du pouvoir &eacute;conomique entre les blocs, les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis demeureront notre
partenaire le plus important et la seule superpuissance au monde.<p>

Pour un pays comme le Canada   un pays fort et dynamique, un pays qui jouit d'un 
tr&egrave;s
grand respect dans le monde   cette relation avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis a un potentiel 
&eacute;norme et
continuera d'offrir des possibilit&eacute;s extraordinaires. Et je ne parle pas 
uniquement de croissance et
de prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;. Je pense que cette relation nous aidera &agrave; 
construire un monde dans lequel nous
serons heureux de vivre et que nous serons fiers de l&eacute;guer &agrave; nos enfants 
et &agrave; nos petits-enfants.<p>

Alors, bien honn&ecirc;tement, je dirais que nous avons beaucoup de chance d'avoir 
les
Am&eacute;ricains comme voisins et amis, mais que les Am&eacute;ricains en ont encore 
plus. <p>

Je vous remercie.<p>

<P><IMG SRC="insecur2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="" HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5>
Microsoft wants its customers to know that it has discovered and fixed a
potential security problem with file and printer sharing in <B><I>Windows 95</I></B>. 
Only customers who have enabled file and printer sharing - a
non-default option - may have been at risk, and, to the best of our knowledge,
no users have been harmed. Nevertheless, Microsoft regards this potential
problem with the greatest seriousness and, we have worked hard over the past
week to resolve it. Microsoft recommends customers using File and Printer
Sharing upgrade to the newer drivers.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="0">How do I know if I am affected?</A></H2>
<P>Only customers that use the File and Printer Sharing option to share their
files with other users on a network are affected. This option is not enabled by
default so unless you have manually enabled it, you are not affected by this
issue. To determine if File and Printer Sharing is enabled, choose the Networks
Option in the Control Panel. You will see a dialog similar to those shown at the
bottom of this and the next page.</P>
<P>If file and printer sharing is enabled, you will see either &quot;File and
Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks&quot; or &quot;File and Printer Sharing
for <B><I>NetWare</I></B> Networks&quot; in the list of installed network
components.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="1">What are the issues?</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="1a">File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks</A></H3>
<P><IMG SRC="insecur4.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 VSPACE=5 ALT="">
Microsoft was recently made aware of an issue with File and Printer sharing
for <B><I>NetWare</I></B> Networks which may affect data security for
corporate users.</P>
<P>Only users whose environments meet both of the following conditions may be
affected:</P></OL>
<LI>They configure their machine to share files and printers with other users
on the network using File and Printer Sharing for NetWare networks (This option
is not turned on by default)</LI>
<LI>They enable remote administration or install Microsoft Remote Registry
Services (These options are not turned on by default)</LI>
</OL>
<P>If your configuration matches that listed above, it is possible for another
user on the network to gain read-only access to your machine after the
administrator has logged off the machine and until you restart your computer. To
correct this problem, Microsoft has issued an updated driver for File and
Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks. The updated driver ensures that only valid
administrators have access to the computer's drive.</P>

<H3><A NAME="1b">File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks</A></H3>
<P><IMG SRC="insecur3.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALT="">
<I>(not MSN: The Microsoft Network online service)</I></P>
<P>Microsoft is also issuing an update for a known problem with File and
Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks and a certain UNIX Shareware network
client (Samba's SMBCLIENT). The update corrects a problem with share-level
security documented in the Microsoft Knowledge Base on October 9th. The update
also includes a correction for a similar problem with user-level security that
Microsoft recently discovered as part of its internal testing of the new driver.</P>
<P>Customers whose environments meet all of the conditions below, may have
their data susceptible to network or Internet hackers:</P><OL>
<LI>They configure their machine to share files and printers with other users
on the network using File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks (This
option is not turned on by default)</LI>
<LI>They share a LAN, Internet, or Dial-Up connection with a UNIX-based
computer running Samba's SMBCLIENT software</LI>
<LI>The network administrator does not disable peer services using System Policies</LI>
</OL>
<P>The Samba SMB client allows its users to send illegal networking commands
over the network. The Samba client is the only known SMB client at this time
that does not filter out such illegal commands. SMBCLIENT users do not
automatically have access to the <B><I>Windows 95</I></B> drive, and must know
the exact steps to send these illegal commands.</P>
<P>The updated driver prevents these illegal commands from being executed,
preventing SMBCLIENT users from accessing the drive on which sharing is enabled.
With the updated driver, the SMBCLIENT user will only have access to those
shared folders that the <B><I>Windows 95</I></B> user has designated.</P>

<H2><A NAME="2">How do I get the Updated Drivers?</A></H2>
<P>(Please note that this only affects English language
versions of <B><I>Windows 95</I></B>.) Both drivers are available for
immediate download from the Internet (<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows"><CODE>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/</CODE></A>),
The <B><I>Microsoft Network</I></B> online service, and is being made
available to other online services including <B><I>CompuServe</I></B>, <B><I>America
Online</I></B>, and <B><I>Prodigy</I></B>. The updated drivers will also be
mailed to any user free of charge if they call <B><I>Microsoft's FastTips</I>
</B> line, 800-936-4200.</P>
<P>Microsoft is committed to providing safe connectivity solutions for
customers. Microsoft takes this responsibility seriously and has worked, and
will continue to work, with great speed to provide solutions for customer
issues.</P>

<center><h2>NOTES POUR UNE ALLOCUTION PRONONC&Eacute;E PAR RAYMOND CHR&Eacute;TIEN,<br>
AMBASSADEUR DU CANADA AUX &Eacute;TATS-UNIS<br>
&Agrave; LA CHAMBRE DE COMMERCE DE LA
R&Eacute;GION M&Eacute;TROPOLITAINE DE MIAMI</h2>

<h3>LE CANADA ET LES AM&Eacute;RIQUES</h3>

<h4>MIAMI, FLORIDE, LE 17 AVRIL 1995</h4></center>
<hr>
<p>

Honorables invit&eacute;s, Mesdames et Messieurs,<p>

Je suis tr&egrave;s honor&eacute; d'avoir l'occasion de prendre la parole devant la 
chambre de commerce
de la r&eacute;gion m&eacute;tropolitaine de Miami.<p>

En tant que citoyen canadien, je me sens presque chez moi en Floride, et plus 
sp&eacute;cialement
entre les mois de novembre et de mai. Comme vous le savez, les Canadiens forment le 
plus gros
effectif de touristes de la Floride, effectif qui se chiffre &agrave; quelque deux 
millions environ chaque
ann&eacute;e.<p>

Et comme Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, je me sens &eacute;galement ici chez moi lorsque 
j'ouvre le Soleil de la
Floride.<p>

Mais il y a d'autres raisons qui expliquent les liens tr&egrave;s &eacute;troits qui 
existent entre le Canada
et la Floride. En 1994, les exportations de la Floride &agrave; destination du Canada 
repr&eacute;sentaient deux
milliards de dollars canadiens environ.<p>


Il y a plus de 50 entreprises canadiennes en Floride et elles emploient quelque 40 
000
Floridiens.<p>

Mais, comme vous allez le d&eacute;couvrir, le Canada, ce n'est pas seulement le 
hockey, les
fronts froids et les touristes. C'est avec impatience que nous attendons, un peu
 plus 
tard dans la
soir&eacute;e, le spectacle des Grands Ballets canadiens au Broward Center for the 
Performing Arts. Je
tiens &agrave; remercier la Concert Association of Florida pour son excellent travail 
: elle pr&eacute;sente dans le
sud de la Floride les meilleures productions culturelles canadiennes.<p>

Mesdames et Messieurs, je veux vous parler aujourd'hui de ce que cela signifie pour 
le
Canada de faire partie des Am&eacute;riques.<p>

Cela nous vaut, tout d'abord, le privil&egrave;ge d'&ecirc;tre le partenaire 
commercial des &Eacute;tats-Unis et
d'avoir avec lui les relations les plus &eacute;troites et les plus compl&egrave;tes 
qui puissent exister entre deux
pays. C'est d'ailleurs pour souligner cette relation exceptionnelle que le 
pr&eacute;sident Clinton s'est
rendu &agrave; Ottawa en f&eacute;vrier dernier.<p>

Nous avons de bonnes raisons de nous en r&eacute;jouir : aucun pays dans le monde 
n'a des
&eacute;changes bilat&eacute;raux aussi importants que nous en avons avec les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis. L'an dernier, le
commerce entre nos deux pays repr&eacute;sentait 371 milliards de dollars canadiens.<p>

Les &eacute;changes commerciaux entre nos deux pays repr&eacute;sentent chaque jour 
plus d'un
milliard de dollars. Nous pouvons &agrave; juste titre &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s fiers du 
climat commercial qui nous permet
d'obtenir des r&eacute;sultats aussi impressionnants.<p>

Si vous le voulez bien, je vous donnerai quelques exemples qui vous permettront de 
situer
ces chiffres dans un contexte plus vaste :<p>

<ul>
<li>Le Canada ach&egrave;te non moins de 24 % des exportations am&eacute;ricaines.<p>

<li>Plus de 80 % des exportations du Canada sont destin&eacute;es au march&eacute; 
am&eacute;ricain.<p>

<li>Pr&egrave;s de 5 millions de Canadiens et d'Am&eacute;ricains ont des emplois qui 
d&eacute;pendent
directement de nos &eacute;changes bilat&eacute;raux.<p>

<li>L'an dernier, le Canada a achet&eacute; plus de deux fois plus de produits 
am&eacute;ricains que
le Japon, qui est votre deuxi&egrave;me partenaire commercial en importance.<p>


<li>Les Canadiens ont achet&eacute; plus de produits des &Eacute;tats-Unis que ne l'ont 
fait
l'ensemble des pays de l'Union europ&eacute;enne.
</ul>
<p>

Pour ce qui est des &eacute;changes entre le Canada et le sud-est des 
&Eacute;tats-Unis, je vous
dirai que le Canada est &agrave; la fois un de vos principaux march&eacute;s 
d'exportation, d'une valeur de plus
de 16 milliards de dollars canadiens, et l'un de vos principaux fournisseurs, avec des 
ventes de
plus de 13 milliards de dollars canadiens.<p>

Enfin, le Canada est la quatri&egrave;me source d'investissements directs en 
importance
dans le sud-est des &Eacute;tats-Unis. De plus, les Canadiens repr&eacute;sentent pour 
cette r&eacute;gion le plus gros
effectif de touristes &eacute;trangers.<p>

&Agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de ces statistiques, il n'est pas &eacute;tonnant que 
notre premier ministre tout
comme votre pr&eacute;sident aient tant insist&eacute; sur les bienfaits de l'ALENA. 
Depuis l'entr&eacute;e en vigueur
de l'ALENA, nos &eacute;changes bilat&eacute;raux ont augment&eacute; de 50 milliards 
de dollars canadiens. Dans le
secteur du commerce bilat&eacute;ral des marchandises, cela repr&eacute;sente une 
augmentation de plus de 900
millions de dollars canadiens par semaine.<p>

Afin d'am&eacute;liorer encore le climat commercial, le premier ministre et le 
pr&eacute;sident ont
annonc&eacute; la signature d'un nouvel accord bilat&eacute;ral sur les services 
a&eacute;riens. Cela s'est d&eacute;j&agrave; traduit
par une baisse des tarifs a&eacute;riens et permettra certainement d'accro&icirc;tre 
le tourisme, de g&eacute;n&eacute;rer des
activit&eacute;s &eacute;conomiques et de cr&eacute;er des milliers d'emplois de part 
et d'autre de la fronti&egrave;re.<p>

Mais nous ne nous limitons pas &agrave; &ecirc;tre le principal partenaire 
commercial l'un de l'autre.
Nous sommes &eacute;galement les deux meilleurs alli&eacute;s du monde. Par exemple, 
gr&acirc;ce &agrave; notre
partenariat au sein du NORAD, qui est le premier commandement militaire binational au 
monde,
nous assurons la d&eacute;fense du continent nord-am&eacute;ricain depuis plus de 35 
ans. Ensemble, nous
avons fond&eacute; l'OTAN et ensemble, nous avons particip&eacute; &agrave; des 
op&eacute;rations de maintien de la paix
partout dans le monde. Le Rwanda, la Somalie et Ha&iuml;ti n'en sont que les exemples 
les plus r&eacute;cents.<p>

Sur le plan international, notre partenariat est &eacute;galement tr&egrave;s 
fructueux.<p>

Le Canada jouit d'une tr&egrave;s solide r&eacute;putation sur la sc&egrave;ne 
internationale. De par ses
caract&eacute;ristiques, il apporte une compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; 
int&eacute;ressante &agrave; la toute puissance des &Eacute;tats-Unis
lorsqu'il s'agit de g&eacute;n&eacute;rer le pouvoir &eacute;conomique et politique 
requis pour appuyer les intentions
par des actes.<p>

Cette compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; accro&icirc;t l'influence de nos deux pays. 
Ensemble, nous avons les
moyens d'accro&icirc;tre la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; et la s&eacute;curit&eacute; dans 
le monde. Cela est clairement ressorti de la
rencontre entre le premier ministre et le pr&eacute;sident Clinton au cours de 
laquelle ces derniers ont
discut&eacute; de diff&eacute;rentes questions de politique &eacute;trang&egrave;re, 
en particulier de la situation en Bosnie et
en Russie, des perspectives de paix dans l'ancienne Yougoslavie et des progr&egrave;s 
en Ha&iuml;ti.<p>

Au chapitre de l'environnement, nous sommes, comme voisins, responsables de la
protection du continent nord-am&eacute;ricain et de la gestion de 40 % des 
r&eacute;serves d'eau douce du
monde. Ensemble, nous veillons &agrave; la protection de notre environnement commun 
et, &agrave; ce chapitre,
nous avons adopt&eacute; des ententes tout &agrave; fait novatrices :<p>

<ul>
<li>l'entente sur les pluies acides et<p>

<li>l'Accord relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans les Grands Lacs. 
</ul>
<p>

Mais, comme moi, vous savez que malgr&eacute; cette relation forte et saine entre 
nos deux pays,
il y a in&eacute;vitablement des divergences de vues. Entre des voisins qui 
entretiennent une amiti&eacute;
durable comme le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis, ces diff&eacute;rences ne nuisent 
pas &agrave; la relation, elles
l'am&eacute;liorent.<p>

Une des questions sur lesquelles nous ne sommes pas d'accord, et qui  a des 
cons&eacute;quences
continentales, est le projet de loi sur Cuba actuellement devant le Congr&egrave;s.<p>

Qu'une chose soit bien claire, si nos politiques sont pas les m&ecirc;mes, le Canada 
et les
&Eacute;tats-Unis poursuivent le m&ecirc;me objectif : la d&eacute;mocratisation 
pacifique de Cuba. Nos protestations
ne sont pas dirig&eacute;es contre cet objectif, mais contre le fait que l'on veuille, 
par cette l&eacute;gislation,
d&eacute;terminer ce que les Canadiens peuvent et ne peuvent pas faire au Canada. 
C'est donc sur ce
point pr&eacute;cis qu'ont port&eacute; nos protestations, comme du reste celles des 
pays de l'Union
europ&eacute;enne.<p>

Les Canadiens pensent que la meilleure fa&ccedil;on de promouvoir la 
d&eacute;mocratie, les droits de la
personne et le changement &eacute;conomique &agrave; Cuba, consiste &agrave; avoir 
avec ce pays des &eacute;changes
diplomatiques, commerciaux et personnels dans un vaste &eacute;ventail de domaines. Le 
Canada
continue, par la voie diplomatique, d'exercer des pressions sur les autorit&eacute;s 
cubaines en ce qui
concerne la violation des droits de la personne. Nous maintenons une politique de 
dialogue et
d'engagement parce que nous jugeons que c'est le meilleur moyen d'appuyer 
l'&eacute;lan qui favorise le
changement &agrave; Cuba.<p>

Mis &agrave; part nos quelques diff&eacute;rences de point de vue, le Canada 
continue d'&ecirc;tre un
partenaire tr&egrave;s solide dans cette vaste relation bilat&eacute;rale qui n'a pas 
son pareil dans le monde. Cela
tient, entre autres, au fait que l'&eacute;conomie canadienne est forte et qu'elle le 
devient de plus en plus.
Vous me pardonnerez de prendre quelques minutes pour faire le pan&eacute;gyrique de 
mon pays!<p>

L'an dernier, le Canada avait un taux de croissance de 4,5 % - le taux le plus 
&eacute;lev&eacute;
de tous les pays du G-7.<p>

D'apr&egrave;s l'OCDE, le croissance &eacute;conomique du Canada dans les deux 
prochaines
ann&eacute;es continuera d'&ecirc;tre sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle des autres pays 
industrialis&eacute;s. <p>

L'an dernier, notre taux d'inflation n'&eacute;tait que de 0,2 %. Et c'&eacute;tait 
la deuxi&egrave;me
ann&eacute;e cons&eacute;cutive o&ugrave; l'inflation &eacute;tait pour ainsi dire 
nulle au Canada.<p>

L'an dernier toujours, la croissance &eacute;conomique a permis de cr&eacute;er 
plus de 430 000
emplois pour une population de moins de 30 millions d'habitants.<p>

Compte tenu de ces chiffres, il n'est pas &eacute;tonnant que les 
b&eacute;n&eacute;fices des entreprises
aient atteint des niveaux records en 1994, de 50 % sup&eacute;rieurs &agrave; ceux de 
1993.<p>

Les march&eacute;s financiers et la communaut&eacute; financi&egrave;re ont bien 
accueilli le dernier budget du
Canada. C'est parce que ce budget fait exactement ce que le gouvernement avait dit 
qu'il ferait :
mettre de l'ordre dans la gestion budg&eacute;taire.<p>

Le gouvernement s'est engag&eacute; &agrave; ramener le d&eacute;ficit, qui est de 
plus de 6 %, &agrave; 3 % d'ici deux
ans. Le budget permettra d'atteindre cet objectif, parce qu'on y accorde la 
priorit&eacute; absolue &agrave; la
r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses. Pour chaque dollar de recettes fiscales, nous 
avons 7 dollars en
compression des d&eacute;penses.<p>

Lors de la visite du pr&eacute;sident Clinton au Canada, le premier ministre 
Chr&eacute;tien a eu
l'occasion de s'entretenir avec lui au sujet du prochain sommet &eacute;conomique du 
G-7. Comme vous
le savez, le Canada est le pays h&ocirc;te du sommet de cette ann&eacute;e. La 
rencontre aura lieu du 15 au 17
juin &agrave; Halifax, en Nouvelle-&Eacute;cosse. Les deux chefs d'&Eacute;tat se sont 
entendus pour travailler
ensemble au succ&egrave;s de l'OMC et pour r&eacute;former les institutions 
financi&egrave;res internationales. Sur des
questions plus proches de nous, ils ont r&eacute;affirm&eacute; souhaiter que l'on 
avance la date d'adh&eacute;sion du
Chili &agrave; l'ALENA. Ils ont &eacute;galement discut&eacute; de leur objectif 
commun : la cr&eacute;ation, d'ici l'an 2005,
de la Zone de libre-&eacute;change des Am&eacute;riques.<p>

Cela m'am&egrave;ne &agrave; aborder une autre dimension du r&ocirc;le du Canada au 
sein des Am&eacute;riques : la
collaboration entre les pays du continent.<p>

Lors de ma derni&egrave;re visite &agrave; Miami, &agrave; l'occasion du sommet 
historique de d&eacute;cembre
dernier... Entre parenth&egrave;ses, je tiens &agrave; f&eacute;liciter les 
organisateurs et les membres de votre
collectivit&eacute; pour cette rencontre extraordinaire... Je disais donc, qu'au 
Sommet de Miami, les
dirigeants de 34 pays se sont entendus pour promouvoir la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute;, la 
d&eacute;mocratie et la s&eacute;curit&eacute;
dans l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re nord.<p>

Depuis d&eacute;cembre, les efforts se poursuivent pour que les objectifs 
&eacute;nonc&eacute;s lors du
Sommet soient atteints. Premi&egrave;rement, le processus qui doit permettre au Chili 
d'adh&eacute;rer &agrave;
l'ALENA a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; entam&eacute; et nous esp&eacute;rons 
que dans les prochaines semaines, le Canada, les
&Eacute;tats-Unis et le Mexique vont engager des n&eacute;gociations officielles en ce 
sens.<p>

Deuxi&egrave;mement, le 30 juin se tiendra &agrave; Denver la premi&egrave;re 
Conf&eacute;rence des ministres du
Commerce de l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re. Cette r&eacute;union nous permettra de faire 
un grand pas en avant en ce qui
concerne la cr&eacute;ation, d'ici l'an 2005, de la Zone de libre-&eacute;change des 
Am&eacute;riques (ZLEA).<p>

L'accession du Chili &agrave; l'ALENA et &agrave; la ZLEA, soit les deux grandes 
r&eacute;alisations de Miami,
refl&egrave;te l'importance de l'expansion des &eacute;changes que sous-tend la 
lib&eacute;ralisation du commerce. Les
pays s'engagent dans des relations de libre-&eacute;change afin d'accro&icirc;tre leur 
avantage concurrentiel et
de relever les d&eacute;fis de la mondialisation des march&eacute;s. La 
prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; en Am&eacute;rique du Nord est
tributaire de la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; de chacune des &eacute;conomies qui en font 
partie.<p>

Tout le monde sait, mais vous qui habitez Miami en &ecirc;tes tout 
particuli&egrave;rement conscients,
que des transformations notables ont eu lieu en Am&eacute;rique latine. Ces 
transformations ont pu &ecirc;tre
r&eacute;alis&eacute;es gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques et 
aux progr&egrave;s de la d&eacute;mocratisation. Prenez
seulement le Chili, l'Argentine et le P&eacute;rou. Ces trois pays connaissent une 
croissance &eacute;conomique
record parce qu'ils ont r&eacute;uni les deux conditions suivantes : stabilit&eacute; 
politique et possibilit&eacute;s
d'investissement int&eacute;ressantes.<p>

Et nous savons que cette situation n'est pas &eacute;ph&eacute;m&egrave;re : les 
gens d'affaire du Canada
cherchent activement &agrave; profiter de ces nouveaux d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s. 
&Agrave; cet &eacute;gard, il faut ajouter qu'en
janvier dernier, notre premier ministre a dirig&eacute; une mission commerciale, 
l'&Eacute;quipe Canada, dans
six pays d'Am&eacute;rique latine et des Antilles. L'&Eacute;quipe Canada a connu 
beaucoup de succ&egrave;s. Elle a
conclu des ententes commerciales repr&eacute;sentant 2,7 milliards de dollars et elle 
a beaucoup
contribu&eacute; &agrave; mieux faire conna&icirc;tre le Canada dans cette 
r&eacute;gion.<p>

Nos &eacute;changes commerciaux avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis seront toujours plus 
importants que ceux
avec d'autres pays. Cela dit, nous avons cependant l'intention de profiter au maximum 
des
possibilit&eacute;s de plus en plus nombreuses qui s'offrent un peu partout dans le 
monde. L'Am&eacute;rique
latine et les Antilles constituent actuellement un march&eacute; de plus de 700 
millions de personnes,
leurs PIB repr&eacute;sentent plus de 9 billiards de dollars US et leurs exportations 
et importations, plus
de 1,5 billiard de dollars US.<p>

Beaucoup d'analystes pensent que dans les dix prochaines ann&eacute;es, 
l'Am&eacute;rique latine sera,
de toutes les r&eacute;gions du monde, celle qui conna&icirc;tra la plus forte 
croissance &eacute;conomique. Et ce
sont l&agrave; de bonnes nouvelles pour nos &eacute;conomies.<p>

Mesdames et Messieurs,<p>

Nous, les Canadiens, sommes des Nord-Am&eacute;ricains. Nous sommes fiers de notre 
grand
h&eacute;misph&egrave;re. Nous sommes par ailleurs de fervents internationalistes. 
Nous apportons le m&ecirc;me
enthousiasme &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration avec les autres pays de 
l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re qu'au soutien des institutions
mondiales, tels que les Nations Unies, l'OTAN et l'OEA de m&ecirc;me que la Banque 
mondiale, le
Fonds mon&eacute;taire international, les deux institutions cr&eacute;&eacute;es 
&agrave; l'issue de la conf&eacute;rence de Bretton
Woods.<p>

Depuis cinquante ans, le Canada t&acirc;che de rallier les autres pays &agrave; son 
credo
internationaliste. Qu'il s'agisse de sa participation &agrave; presque toutes les 
missions de maintien de la
paix de l'ONU, comme celle qui s'est d&eacute;roul&eacute;e en Ha&iuml;ti; du sommet 
du G-7 &agrave; Halifax o&ugrave; sera
entrepris le processus de modernisation des institutions cr&eacute;&eacute;es &agrave; 
l'issue de la conf&eacute;rence de
Bretton Woods; ou encore de son engagement en ce qui concerne l'&eacute;largissement 
de l'ALENA et
la cr&eacute;ation de la ZLEA, le Canada met &agrave; contribution une expertise, une 
exp&eacute;rience et une &eacute;nergie
remarquables.<p>

C'est pour cette raison que votre pays trouvera toujours dans le mien, le Canada, un
partenaire comp&eacute;tent et fort, un partenaire sur lequel il pourra compter pour 
am&eacute;liorer la vie de
tous les habitants du vaste continent am&eacute;ricain : de l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord, 
de l'Am&eacute;rique centrale et
de l'Am&eacute;rique du Sud. Les &Eacute;tats-Unis trouveront aussi dans le Canada un 
partenaire soucieux
d'enrichir encore cette relation extraordinaire qui est la relation bilat&eacute;rale 
la plus compl&egrave;te et la
plus fructueuse au monde.<p>

Je vous remercie. Si vous avez des questions, je serai tr&egrave;s heureux d'y 
r&eacute;pondre.<p>

<hr>
<p>

H&ocirc;te du Sommet &eacute;conomique annuel des dirigeants du Groupe des sept pays 
les plus
industrialis&eacute;s, &agrave; Halifax en Nouvelle-&Eacute;cosse, du 15 au 17 juin 
derniers, le premier ministre du
Canada, M. Jean Chr&eacute;tien, a indiqu&eacute; que pour lui l'une des issues les 
plus notables de la r&eacute;union
r&eacute;side dans les propositions visant &agrave; renforcer l'aptitude du Fonds 
mon&eacute;taire international &agrave; r&eacute;agir
rapidement aux crises financi&egrave;res. M. Chr&eacute;tien avait fait de la 
r&eacute;forme des institutions financi&egrave;res
internationales sa  priorit&eacute; personnelle  &agrave; titre de pr&eacute;sident du 
Sommet.<p>

Les six autres leaders pr&eacute;sents &eacute;taient le pr&eacute;sident des 
&Eacute;tats-Unis, M. Bill Clinton, le premier
ministre de la Grande-Bretagne, M. John Major, le chancelier de l'Allemagne, M. Helmut 
Kohl, le
pr&eacute;sident de la France, M. Jacques Chirac, le premier ministre du Japon, M. 
Tomiichi Murayama,
le premier ministre de l'Italie, M. Lamberto Dini, et le pr&eacute;sident de l'Union 
europ&eacute;enne, M.
Jacques Santer. Le pr&eacute;sident de la Russie, M. Boris Eltsine, s'est joint au 
groupe le 16 juin pour
prendre part aux discussions sur des dossiers politiques et mondiaux.<p>

En sa qualit&eacute; de pr&eacute;sident du Sommet, M. Chr&eacute;tien a jou&eacute; 
un r&ocirc;le de premier plan dans
l'&eacute;tablissement de l'ordre du jour et dans l'orientation des discussions vers 
un consensus. Au d&eacute;but
des travaux de planification de la r&eacute;union, il a d&eacute;clar&eacute; qu'il 
voulait qu'elle soit comme  une
Chevrolet , manifestant ainsi sa volont&eacute; d'en d&eacute;mordre avec l'apparat 
qui a caract&eacute;ris&eacute; nombre de
sommets ant&eacute;rieurs, pour s'attacher aux dossiers cl&eacute;s. <p>

Le premier ministre Chr&eacute;tien a expos&eacute; les objectifs que poursuivrait le 
Canada lors des discussions
de Halifax, dans un discours prononc&eacute; &agrave; Montr&eacute;al &agrave; la 
veille du Sommet.  Le d&eacute;nominateur
commun de tous ces dossiers, a-t-il dit,  est le besoin d'une meilleure 
compr&eacute;hension et
collaboration internationales pour faire face au vent de scepticisme qui s'abat sur 
nos institutions
internationales.<p>

Les emplois et la croissance &eacute;conomique sont prioritaires pour tous les pays 
du G7, a ajout&eacute; M.
Chr&eacute;tien &agrave; Montr&eacute;al, et ... la lib&eacute;ralisation des 
&eacute;changes est le levier international le plus efficace
qui soit pour promouvoir l'emploi et la croissance . Il a exhort&eacute; les autres 
membres du G-7 &agrave; se
joindre au Canada pour faire fond sur l'issue heureuse des n&eacute;gociations du GATT 
et  mettre en
place l'Organisation mondiale du commerce (OMC). <p>

Reconnaissant les progr&egrave;s r&eacute;alis&eacute;s par le Canada et d'autres pays 
participant au Sommet dans la
r&eacute;duction de la dette et la ma&icirc;trise de l'inflation, M. Chr&eacute;tien a 
toutefois soulign&eacute; que  des
&eacute;conomies nationales saines ne sauraient exister lorsque l'&eacute;conomie 
mondiale est en mauvaise
posture.  &Agrave; son avis, les dirigeants du Sommet pourraient contribuer grandement 
&agrave; assainir le
syst&egrave;me &eacute;conomique mondial en r&eacute;duisant la 
vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; des &eacute;conomies nationales aux
fluctuations sauvages des monnaies, question dont l'urgence est attest&eacute;e par 
les r&eacute;percussions
mondiales de la r&eacute;cente crise financi&egrave;re du Mexique. M. Chr&eacute;tien 
a appel&eacute; ses coll&egrave;gues, d'une
part,  &agrave; renforcer l'aptitude du FMI &agrave; suivre l'&eacute;volution de la 
sant&eacute; financi&egrave;re de ses membres et,
d'autre part, &agrave; lui donner les ressources financi&egrave;res qui lui 
permettraient d'agir de fa&ccedil;on d&eacute;cisive en
cas de crise.<p>

M. Chr&eacute;tien a exprim&eacute; l'espoir que ses coll&egrave;gues s'attacheront 
&agrave; ce que deux autres institutions
internationales n&eacute;es apr&egrave;s la guerre, soit la Banque mondiale et l'ONU, 
fassent l'usage le plus
judicieux possible de leurs ressources financi&egrave;res et que ces organismes et 
d'autres institutions
financi&egrave;res destinent les maigres fonds dont elles disposent principalement aux 
pays les plus
pauvres.<p>

Le Canada pr&eacute;conise de longue date une r&eacute;forme en profondeur de l'ONU, 
et le premier ministre
Chr&eacute;tien a demand&eacute; &agrave; ses coll&egrave;gues de contribuer &agrave; 
la consolidation de l'Organisation.  Il y a trop
d'organismes et de programmes (de l'ONU) qui entrent soit en conflit les uns avec les 
autres, ou
dont le mandat ne correspond plus aux probl&egrave;mes actuels. <p>

Le communiqu&eacute; conjoint &eacute;mis &agrave; la cl&ocirc;ture des discussions 
couvrait les principales pr&eacute;occupations
du Canada, en l'occurrence :<p>

<ul>
<li>une ferme recommandation au FMI d'&eacute;tablir des d&eacute;lais-rep&egrave;res 
pour la publication en temps
opportun de donn&eacute;es &eacute;conomiques et financi&egrave;res sur les pays et 
d'adresser des messages plus
francs aux pays qui semblent &eacute;viter de prendre les mesures n&eacute;cessaires. 
<p>

<li>une proposition visant &agrave; doubler, pour le porter &agrave; 58 millions de 
dollars US,  le montant dont  le

place
&#187;  et qui entravent le commerce et l'investissement et &agrave;

<p>

&Agrave; la fin des discussions sur les questions &eacute;conomiques &agrave; l'ordre 
du jour du Sommet, le pr&eacute;sident
de la Russie, Boris Eltsine, s'est joint au Groupe pour discuter de diverses questions 
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
mondial.<p>

L'escalade des combats en Bosnie et le sort des 26 casques bleus de l'ONU (dont 12 
Canadiens)
tenus en otages par les Serbes de Bosnie ont &eacute;t&eacute; parmi les sujets 
pr&eacute;pond&eacute;rants des discussions.
En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, les dirigeants du G-7 s'&eacute;taient attach&eacute;s 
&agrave; la question durant le d&icirc;ner d'ouverture (au lieu
de discuter tel que pr&eacute;vu de questions &eacute;conomiques) apr&egrave;s quoi le 
premier ministre Chr&eacute;tien a lu
en leur nom un appel &agrave; la mod&eacute;ration et &agrave; la lib&eacute;ration 
des otages. Ult&eacute;rieurement, M. Chr&eacute;tien a 
en son nom propre demand&eacute; l'aide du pr&eacute;sident Eltsine pour qu'il tente 
de persuader les Serbes de
Bosnie de lib&eacute;rer les casques bleus. Les Serbes avaient lib&eacute;r&eacute; 
tous les otages le 18 juin.<p>

Le Canada compte plus de 2 000 casques bleus en Bosnie et en Croatie.<p>

Les huit leaders ont r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute; leur engagement &agrave; 
l'&eacute;gard d'une action multilat&eacute;rale sous les auspices
des Nations unies tout en souscrivant &agrave; l'appel du Canada en faveur d'une plus 
vaste r&eacute;forme des
structures financi&egrave;res et politiques de l'Organisation. La capacit&eacute; de 
r&eacute;action rapide de l'ONU, &agrave;
ce qu'a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le premier ministre Chr&eacute;tien apr&egrave;s la 
r&eacute;union, constitue un point d'importance
particuli&egrave;re pour le Canada.<p>

Avant de partir pour Washington, le pr&eacute;sident Bill Clinton a 
d&eacute;clar&eacute; que son h&ocirc;te canadien avait
tenu sa promesse d'organiser un sommet sans pompes, une  Chevrolet  comme il disait. 
De l'avis
du pr&eacute;sident am&eacute;ricain, plus que bon nombre de sommets 
ant&eacute;rieurs, celui-ci a abouti &agrave; des
suggestions plus pragmatiques, plus informelles et plus pr&eacute;cises sur les moyens 
d'augmenter le
niveau de vie de nos peuples. De son c&ocirc;t&eacute;, le pr&eacute;sident de la 
France, M. Chirac, a plaid&eacute; en faveur
du maintien de cette simplicit&eacute; lors du sommet de Lyon en 1996.<p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
NCRADD:  One or more of your SCSI devices is malfunctioning.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
NCR 53c810 SCSI Adapter
<h2>Problem</h2>
The adapter has not been configured to use level triggering.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Change the adapter so that it uses LEVEL triggering as per the

<h2>Notes</h2>
I have had problems with my NCR 53c810 since februar 1995 with OS/2 Warp ver. 
3.0. I got the very same error message as you:
<p>
NCRADD:  One or more of your SCSI devices is malfunctioning.
<p>
I have found that it is not the NCR 53c810 nor the OS2CAM.ADD which has guilt 
in making this trouble. The problem is the MANUAL for the NCR 53c810 which 
recommends to use EDGE triggering.
<p>
I trusted the manual to be correct in this statement. But after sending and 
receiving some email to NCR.
<p>
I found that it is the LEVEL triggering which works with OS2CAM.ADD.
<p>
After I changed to LEVEL triggering on the NCR 53c810 (with jumper settings) 
all my SCSI devices works in OS2CAM.ADD. I have a Pioneer DRM 604x SCSI CD-ROM 
player, and now it works very well.
<p>
I am also able to install LINUX on my computer when using LEVEL triggering. I 
have tried to install LINUX on my computer since Autumn 1994 with no success. 
I could not access any SCSI devices earlier. But suddenly everything worked 
with LEVEL triggering.
<p>
But LINUX is even more specific to configure than OS/2 WARP. I had to put my 
motherboard to INT C (with jumpers) for the PCI slot 1, and my NCR 53c810 to 
INTR C# LEVEL triggering (with jumpers). In the CMOS BIOS Setup I had to put 
my NCR 53c810 to irq=11, and PCI slot 1 to irq=11. It was important to put the 
irq=11 two places in the CMOS BIOS Setup for LINUX installation. The MANUAL 
for my motherboard GA 586 IS told me that INT C requires irq=11. The 
motherboard MANUAL said:
<p>
<pre>
    INT A  means irq=9
    INT B  means irq=10
    INT C  means irq=11
    INT D  means irq=14
</pre>
<p>
I hope this makes it clearer to other users of the NCR 53c810.

<center><h2>Le projet Grande-Baleine:  Fichier</h2></center>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Le 18 novembre 1994, le gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec a fait savoir qu'il ne 
consid&eacute;rait plus le projet
Grande-Baleine comme prioritaire pour un avenir rapproch&eacute;. Par 
cons&eacute;quent, le 14 d&eacute;cembre
1994, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec a inform&eacute; les 
autorit&eacute;s f&eacute;d&eacute;rales et provinciales charg&eacute;es de
l'examen des effets environnementaux qu'elle attendrait l'issue des discussions 
provinciales sur la
question de l'&eacute;nergie annonc&eacute;es par le gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec 
avant de prendre une d&eacute;cision
quant &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de poursuivre l'examen de sa proposition.<p>

<h3>NATURE DU PROJET</h3>

Le projet Grande-Baleine fait partie d'un plan &agrave; long terme 
d'Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec, soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;
appartenant au gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec, qui vise l'exploitation du potentiel 
hydro-&eacute;lectrique de
plusieurs cours d'eau du nord du Qu&eacute;bec se jetant dans la baie James et la baie 
d'Hudson. La
premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape du projet s'est amorc&eacute;e avec la construction, au 
d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 70, d'une
centrale &eacute;lectrique sur la Grande Rivi&egrave;re. Selon Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec, 
une autre centrale, sur la Grande
rivi&egrave;re de la Baleine celle-l&agrave;, s'av&egrave;re n&eacute;cessaire pour 
r&eacute;pondre aux besoins accrus du Qu&eacute;bec en
&eacute;lectricit&eacute;. Cette nouvelle installation aurait une puissance 
install&eacute;e de 3 212 m&eacute;gawatts et
exigerait la submersion de 672 milles carr&eacute;s de terre. Quelque 5 % des 22 000 
milles carr&eacute;s du
bassin d'alimentation de la Grande rivi&egrave;re de la Baleine seraient 
touch&eacute;s par la r&eacute;alisation du
projet.<p>

<h3>&Eacute;TUDES D'IMPACT SUR L'ENVIRONNEMENT</h3>

Le gouvernement du Canada, celui du Qu&eacute;bec, les Cris et les Inuit de la baie 
James ainsi qu'Hydro
Qu&eacute;bec signaient en 1975 la Convention de la Baie James et du Nord 
qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois (CBJNQ).<p>

Premier grand r&egrave;glement des revendications territoriales, la CBJNQ a une 
port&eacute;e immense qui
s'exerce sur plus de 400 000 milles carr&eacute;s du territoire nordique 
qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. La Convention repose
sur deux principes directeurs tout aussi importants l'un que l'autre : la 
n&eacute;cessit&eacute; pour le Qu&eacute;bec
d'utiliser les ressources de son territoire pour le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice de tous ses 
r&eacute;sidents et la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de
reconna&icirc;tre que les peuples autochtones, les Cris et les Inuit, ont une culture 
et un mode de vie
diff&eacute;rents de ceux des autres Qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois. Ainsi, la Convention 
&eacute;tablit un syst&egrave;me de gestion des
terres et des r&eacute;gimes visant &agrave; la fois le d&eacute;veloppement social et 
la protection de l'environnement.
Pour ce qui concerne ces r&eacute;gimes, la CBJNQ pr&eacute;voit la participation 
directe de repr&eacute;sentants des
Cris et des Inuit aux divers comit&eacute;s d'examen.<p>

En raison de son emplacement g&eacute;ographique sur le territoire vis&eacute; par la 
CBJNQ, la proposition
relative au projet Grande-Baleine est assujettie &agrave; quatre processus d'examen 
des effets
environnementaux pr&eacute;vus par la CBJNQ. En outre, la proposition doit &ecirc;tre 
soumise au processus
f&eacute;d&eacute;ral d'&eacute;valuation et d'examen en mati&egrave;re 
d'environnement. Pour assurer l'&eacute;valuation compl&egrave;te et
coordonn&eacute;e du projet, l'examen des effets environnementaux est r&eacute;gi par 
un protocole d'entente,
conclu en janvier 1992 entre les Cris et les Inuit du Qu&eacute;bec, d'une part, et le 
gouvernement du
Canada et celui du Qu&eacute;bec, d'autre part. Ces derniers ont d&eacute;clar&eacute; 
qu'aucune d&eacute;cision ne serait
prise ni qu'aucune construction ne commencerait avant l'ach&egrave;vement des examens.
<p>

Plusieurs groupes d'examen ont tenu des audiences publiques dans des 
collectivit&eacute;s nordiques
ainsi que dans des grandes villes du Qu&eacute;bec, afin de d&eacute;terminer les 
pr&eacute;occupations de la
population et d'&eacute;laborer des lignes directrices &agrave; l'intention 
d'Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec pour la pr&eacute;paration de
son &eacute;nonc&eacute; des incidences environnementales (EIE). Le 10 septembre 1992, 
les administrateurs
f&eacute;d&eacute;raux et provinciaux de la CBJNQ et les membres de la Commission 
f&eacute;d&eacute;rale d'examen des
&eacute;valuations environnementales ont remis &agrave; Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec les lignes 
directrices finales visant l'EIE.
Jamais un projet d'une telle envergure en Am&eacute;rique du Nord n'a 
&eacute;t&eacute; assorti de lignes directrices
aussi compl&egrave;tes ni aussi d&eacute;taill&eacute;es.<p>

Selon ces lignes directrices, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec doit d&eacute;montrer qu'il existe 
un besoin r&eacute;el d'accro&icirc;tre la
puissance install&eacute;e et d'exploiter d'autres ressources 
&eacute;nerg&eacute;tiques. La soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'&Eacute;tat doit ensuite
prouver que toutes les autres solutions possibles pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; cet 
accroissement de la
demande, y compris les programmes de rentabilit&eacute; &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique et 
les programmes li&eacute;s &agrave; la
demande, ont &eacute;t&eacute; examin&eacute;es. (Selon les estimations 
d'Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec, les mesures relatives &agrave;
l'&eacute;conomie d'&eacute;nergie permettront de satisfaire environ 37 % des besoins 
suppl&eacute;mentaires en
&eacute;nergie d'ici 2005.) La soci&eacute;t&eacute; doit prendre des mesures 
relativement &agrave; l'impact global du projet
sur tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me, notamment en ce qui 
concerne les questions
transfrontali&egrave;res (dans le cas des oiseaux migrateurs par exemple), et sur les 
conditions
climatiques mondiales. Elle doit en outre faire en sorte que le projet respecte le 
droit des
collectivit&eacute;s locales &agrave; d&eacute;terminer leurs objectifs sociaux 
futurs.<p>

Le 31 ao&ucirc;t 1993, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; son 
&eacute;nonc&eacute; des incidences environnementales (EIE)
du projet Grande-Baleine sur l'environnement. Le 18 novembre 1994, les comit&eacute;s 
d'examen ont
termin&eacute; l'analyse de conformit&eacute; des donn&eacute;es, afin de 
d&eacute;terminer si les lignes directrices pour la
r&eacute;daction de l'EIE avaient &eacute;t&eacute; respect&eacute;es. Apr&egrave;s 
avoir analys&eacute; les renseignements contenus dans le
document de 5000 pages, les groupes d'examen ont conclu que l'EIE comportait un 
certain
nombre de lacunes importantes et qu'il &eacute;tait de ce fait impossible de 
d&eacute;finir clairement et de faire
conna&icirc;tre les r&eacute;percussions du projet. Quant &agrave; la 
n&eacute;cessit&eacute; du projet, les groupes ont conclu que
l'EIE ne contenait pas une analyse ad&eacute;quate du co&ucirc;t des autres sources 
d'&eacute;nergie envisageables et
que les possibilit&eacute;s d'&eacute;conomie d'&eacute;nergie n'avaient pas 
&eacute;t&eacute; explor&eacute;es &agrave; fond. Afin qu'ils puissent
estimer convenablement les co&ucirc;ts et les avantages du projet sur le plan de 
l'environnement, les
comit&eacute;s ont demand&eacute; &agrave; Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec de fournir d'autres 
renseignements. Dans la r&eacute;daction de
leur rapport, les groupes d'examen ont tenu compte des commentaires relatifs &agrave; 
l'EIE qu'ils avaient
re&ccedil;us des participants aux audiences publiques qui avaient eu lieu de 
f&eacute;vrier &agrave; juillet 1994.<p>

Par suite de la d&eacute;cision du gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec de suspendre le 
projet, le processus
d'examen des effets environnementaux a &eacute;t&eacute; report&eacute;. 
Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec devrait, d'ici la fin de 1995,
d&eacute;cider si elle abandonne le projet ou si elle poursuit son &eacute;valuation 
environnementale. Dans ce
dernier cas, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec devrait entreprendre d'autres &eacute;tudes afin de 
satisfaire aux exigences
des lignes directrices concernant l'EIE. Une fois ces &eacute;tudes termin&eacute;es, 
on tiendrait des audiences
publiques auxquelles pourraient participer toutes les parties 
int&eacute;ress&eacute;es. Les groupes d'examen
soumettraient alors leur rapport aux administrateurs de la CBJNQ ainsi qu'au ministre 
f&eacute;d&eacute;ral de
l'Environnement et au ministre f&eacute;d&eacute;ral du Transport, qui sont 
charg&eacute;s de d&eacute;clencher l'examen en
vertu du d&eacute;cret sur les lignes directrices visant le processus 
f&eacute;d&eacute;ral d'&eacute;valuation et d'examen en
mati&egrave;re d'environnement. <p>

<h3>IMPACT SUR LES COMMUNAUT&Eacute;S AUTOCHTONES</h3>

La Convention de la Baie James et du Nord qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois donne aux 
communaut&eacute;s autochtones du
Qu&eacute;bec un degr&eacute; d'autonomie gouvernementale in&eacute;gal&eacute; en 
Am&eacute;rique du Nord. Aux termes de la
CBJNQ et de cinq ententes subs&eacute;quentes, le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral, 
Qu&eacute;bec et Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec ont
vers&eacute; 505 millions de dollars en d&eacute;dommagement aux quelque 18 000 Cris, 
Inuit et indiens
naskapis. La qualit&eacute; de vie de ces communaut&eacute;s s'est donc grandement 
am&eacute;lior&eacute;e depuis le milieu
des ann&eacute;es 70. La mortalit&eacute; infantile chez les Cris a diminu&eacute; de 
50 % et l'esp&eacute;rance de vie s'est
accrue de quelque 30 &agrave; 40 ans, portant ainsi ces caract&eacute;ristiques 
d&eacute;mographiques &agrave; des niveaux
comparables &agrave; la moyenne nationale.<p>

Pour aider les Cris &agrave; pr&eacute;server leur mode de vie traditionnel, le 
gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec offre un
programme de s&eacute;curit&eacute; du revenu qui sert &agrave; subventionner des 
activit&eacute;s traditionnelles comme le
pi&eacute;geage, la chasse et la p&ecirc;che. En effet, le nombre de chasseurs 
&agrave; plein temps chez les Cris n'a
pas vari&eacute; de 1976 &agrave; 1991. Les Cris et les Inuit participent 
d&eacute;sormais pleinement &agrave; une &eacute;conomie
bas&eacute;e sur les salaires et environ 10 % d'entre eux seulement tirent leurs 
revenus d'activit&eacute;s
traditionnelles. Gr&acirc;ce aux sommes vers&eacute;es dans le cadre de la CBJNQ, bon 
nombre de Cris ont
mis sur pied des entreprises non traditionnelles, notamment des entreprises de 
construction, des
restaurants, des motels, deux compagnies a&eacute;riennes et une entreprise de 
fabrication de bateaux.<p>

La r&eacute;alisation du projet Grande-Baleine pourrait avoir des r&eacute;percussions 
positives et n&eacute;gatives
pour les Autochtones, dont les plus touch&eacute;s seraient les 450 Inuit de 
Kuujjuarapik et les 500 Cris
de Whapmagoostui. Toutefois, elle ne menacerait pas les activit&eacute;s 
traditionnelles et ne
n&eacute;cessiterait la relocalisation d'aucun village.<p>

<h3>IMPACT SUR LA FAUNE</h3>


La cr&eacute;ation de r&eacute;servoirs entra&icirc;ne le d&eacute;placement de 
certains habitats fauniques, pourtant la
plupart des populations animales dans le nord du Qu&eacute;bec sont demeur&eacute;es 
stables ou ont augment&eacute;
depuis le d&eacute;but des travaux d'am&eacute;nagement hydro-&eacute;lectrique dans 
la r&eacute;gion. Par exemple, la
population des caribous est pass&eacute;e de 200 000 t&ecirc;tes en 1970 &agrave; 700 
000 aujourd'hui. Selon les
r&eacute;sultats d'&eacute;tudes, il semble que les r&eacute;servoirs incitent les 
troupeaux de caribous &agrave; migrer vers des
r&eacute;gions o&ugrave; la nourriture est plus accessible. En ce qui concerne les 10 
000 caribous qui ont p&eacute;ri
noy&eacute;s en septembre 1984, les autorit&eacute;s canadiennes et 
qu&eacute;b&eacute;coises ont &eacute;tudi&eacute; l'incident et ont
conclu que l'am&eacute;nagement hydro-&eacute;lectrique n'en &eacute;tait pas la 
cause. En fait, ce genre d'incident est
fr&eacute;quent. Entre 1973 et 1983, le minist&egrave;re qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois du 
Loisir, de la Chasse et de la P&ecirc;che a
enregistr&eacute; des noyades de caribous &agrave; plus de 30 endroits 
diff&eacute;rents dans le Nord qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois.<p>

Apr&egrave;s la construction du complexe La Grande, moins de 10 000 des 1,1 million 
d'oiseaux
terrestres migrateurs (soit 1 %) ont d&ucirc; changer leurs habitudes de nidification. 
&Agrave; titre de
comparaison, les Cris capturent annuellement 150 000 oiseaux. Les b&eacute;lugas que 
l'on retrouve dans
l'estuaire de la Petite rivi&egrave;re de la Baleine ne seront pas menac&eacute;s par 
le projet Grande-Baleine.<p>

La contamination par le mercure est une des pr&eacute;occupations l&eacute;gitimes que 
suscite la cr&eacute;ation de
r&eacute;servoirs pour le projet Grande-Baleine. Le mercure, qui se trouve dans le sol 
et dans le milieu
aquatique, est transform&eacute; et rejet&eacute; dans l'eau quand la terre est 
inond&eacute;e. Selon certaines &eacute;tudes, les
r&eacute;servoirs devraient revenir &agrave; leur &eacute;tat naturel apr&egrave;s une 
p&eacute;riode de 20 &agrave; 30 ans. L'accroissement
des niveaux de mercure dans le milieu marin sera minime, les niveaux plus 
&eacute;lev&eacute;s seront localis&eacute;s
et n'alt&eacute;reront pas la sant&eacute; des poissons. De plus, selon des articles 
parus r&eacute;cemment dans des
revues scientifiques, les centrales &agrave; combustible fossile, y compris celles que 
l'on trouve aux
&Eacute;tats-Unis et au Canada, sont une importante source de pollution 
atmosph&eacute;rique par le mercure.
Il convient de noter que, malgr&eacute; une surveillance continue, les 
autorit&eacute;s locales en mati&egrave;re de
sant&eacute; n'ont signal&eacute; aucun cas d'intoxication par le mercure depuis le 
d&eacute;but des travaux de
construction du complexe La Grande.<p>

Depuis 1986, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec a parrain&eacute; un programme de 12 millions de 
dollars pour &eacute;tudier et
att&eacute;nuer l'impact de ce probl&egrave;me dans la r&eacute;gion du complexe La 
Grande. Des mesures semblables
seraient adopt&eacute;es pour la r&eacute;gion du complexe Grande-Baleine. 
Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec travaille avec le
Conseil cri de la sant&eacute; et des services sociaux de la Baie James &agrave; 
informer la population locale au
sujet des restrictions relatives &agrave; la consommation de poisson nuisible. Ce type 
de poisson se
trouve &agrave; un niveau plus &eacute;lev&eacute; de la cha&icirc;ne alimentaire et, 
par cons&eacute;quent, risque davantage de
pr&eacute;senter des niveaux &eacute;lev&eacute;s de mercure. Le cor&eacute;gone, 
poisson non nuisible et &eacute;l&eacute;ment courant de
l'alimentation des Cris, ne fait cependant l'objet d'aucune restriction quant &agrave; 
sa consommation. De
fait, les Cris ont demand&eacute; au gouvernement des permis de p&ecirc;che 
commerciale pour p&ecirc;cher ce
poisson dans le r&eacute;servoir LG-2.<p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

&Agrave; la suite de sa d&eacute;cision de suspendre l'examen des effets 
environnementaux du projet
Grande-Baleine, le gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec a indiqu&eacute; qu'il avait 
l'intention de mettre davantage
l'accent sur l'efficience et la conservation &agrave; l'avenir. Dans cette optique, il 
tiendra des audiences
publiques du 25 mai au 17 juin 1995 pour explorer et analyser les possibilit&eacute;s 
qui s'offrent au
Qu&eacute;bec en mati&egrave;re d'&eacute;nergie. Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec tient &agrave; 
participer pleinement aux discussions
publiques sur la politique de l'&eacute;nergie du Qu&eacute;bec et attendra l'issue de 
ces discussions avant de
d&eacute;cider, d'ici la fin de 1995, si elle ira plus loin ou non en ce qui concerne 
le projet
Grande-Baleine. Si le gouvernement du Qu&eacute;bec donne le feu vert &agrave; la 
poursuite du processus
d'examen des effets environnementaux, Hydro-Qu&eacute;bec devra aviser les 
autorit&eacute;s f&eacute;d&eacute;rales et
provinciales de reprendre l'examen. La soci&eacute;t&eacute; devra de plus donner 
suite au rapport relatif &agrave; la
conformit&eacute; aux exigences. Des audiences publiques sur la proposition pourraient 
avoir lieu une
fois que les renseignements suppl&eacute;mentaires fournis seront jug&eacute;s 
satisfaisants pour justifier la
tenue de telles audiences.<p>

<i>Trait&eacute; relatif aux eaux limitrophes de 1909 entre le Canada et les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis</i>

<p>

[Tous les montants sont en dollars canadiens.]

<p>

Depuis la signature du Trait&eacute; relatif aux eaux limitrophes de 1909, le Canada 
et les &Eacute;tats-Unis
reconnaissent qu'ils ont tous les deux int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; prot&eacute;ger 
les eaux qui traversent la fronti&egrave;re. Nulle
part ailleurs, la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de coop&eacute;rer ne se fait-elle plus 
sentir que dans le bassin des Grands Lacs,
la plus importante source d'eau douce de surface du monde.<p>

Un Canadien sur trois (environ 8,5 millions) et un Am&eacute;ricain sur neuf (27,7 
millions)
r&eacute;sident dans ce bassin, centre industriel des deux pays o&ugrave; se situent 
un cinqui&egrave;me des industries
am&eacute;ricaines et la moiti&eacute; des industries canadiennes. Une telle 
concentration de population et
d'industries contribue &agrave; la prosp&eacute;rit&eacute; des deux pays, mais 
cr&eacute;e &eacute;galement un &eacute;norme stress sur
l'environnement. Aussi, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont-ils adopt&eacute; des 
lois interdisant ou
restreignant l'utilisation de produits chimiques toxiques et d&eacute;pens&eacute;, 
tout comme leurs industries,
des milliards de dollars en mat&eacute;riel de traitement des d&eacute;chets et de 
contr&ocirc;le de la pollution Ces
efforts ont donn&eacute; des r&eacute;sultats. &Agrave; preuve, l'eau des lacs est 
visiblement plus propre qu'elle ne
l'&eacute;tait au milieu du si&egrave;cle, les apports de m&eacute;taux toxiques et de 
mati&egrave;res chimiques organiques ont
diminu&eacute; et les niveaux de contamination des poissons et des oiseaux aquatiques 
sont beaucoup
moins &eacute;lev&eacute;s qu'au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1970.<p>

Toutefois, assainir les lacs s'av&egrave;re plus compliqu&eacute; que pr&eacute;vu 
Par exemple, nous savons
maintenant que certains produits chimiques toxiques sont r&eacute;manents et que, une 
fois lib&eacute;r&eacute;s dans
l'environnement, ils y demeurent longtemps et se dispersent facilement. M&ecirc;me si 
l'on arr&ecirc;te de les
d&eacute;verser directement, ils peuvent p&eacute;n&eacute;trer les lacs par leurs 
affluents, des eaux souterraines ou
l'atmosph&egrave;re. Ils peuvent s'accumuler de plus en plus loin dans la cha&icirc;ne 
alimentaire et menacer la
sant&eacute; des &ecirc;tres humains.<p>

Devant le d&eacute;fi que posent les substances toxiques r&eacute;manentes, le Canada 
et les &Eacute;tats-Unis
ont d&eacute;cid&eacute; ensemble d'adopter l'approche de l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me 
pour combattre la pollution dans les
Grands Lacs. Cette approche reconna&icirc;t que tous les &eacute;l&eacute;ments d'un 
m&ecirc;me environnement (air,
terre, eau et organismes vivants) sont interd&eacute;pendants et qu'une substance ou 
une action qui
affecte l'un des &eacute;l&eacute;ments aura des r&eacute;percussions sur les autres.
<p>

L'approche de l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me met l'accent sur la pr&eacute;vention de la 
pollution d&egrave;s le d&eacute;part
plut&ocirc;t que sur les efforts pour enrayer ses effets. Elle met &eacute;galement en 
&eacute;vidence la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une
collaboration entre les gouvernements, l'industrie, les groupes environnementaux et 
les citoyens.<p>

Se trouvant en bordure de tous les lacs du c&ocirc;t&eacute; canadien de la 
fronti&egrave;re, la province de
l'Ontario g&egrave;re, de concert avec le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral du 
Canada, l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me du bassin des
Grands Lacs. Ce programme de coop&eacute;ration se fonde sur le concept du 
d&eacute;veloppement durable,
dont l'objectif est de garantir aux g&eacute;n&eacute;rations actuelles et futures un 
environnement sain et une
&eacute;conomie en plein sant&eacute;. Les quatre grands volets du programme sont les 
suivants :<p>

<ul>

<li> r&eacute;parer les erreurs pass&eacute;es (remettre en &eacute;tat les 
r&eacute;gions et les habitats d&eacute;t&eacute;rior&eacute;s);<p>

<li>pr&eacute;venir et contr&ocirc;ler la pollution;<p>

<li>sauvegarder et prot&eacute;ger la sant&eacute; des &ecirc;tres humains et de 
l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me; et<p>

<li>prendre des d&eacute;cisions scientifiquement fond&eacute;es.
</ul>
<p>

Le Canada et l'Ontario accordent depuis longtemps la priorit&eacute; &agrave; 
l'assainissement des lacs et
r&eacute;alisent des progr&egrave;s consid&eacute;rables sur le plan des sciences 
lacustres, du contr&ocirc;le de la sant&eacute;, du
d&eacute;veloppement technologique et de la participation de la collectivit&eacute;. 
Ils sont d&eacute;termin&eacute;s &agrave;
poursuivre leur collaboration avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis en vue d'assainir les Grands 
Lacs.<p>

<h3>HISTOIRE D'UN PARTENARIAT</h3>

Le partenariat canado-am&eacute;ricain dans le dossier des Grands Lacs remonte au 
Trait&eacute; relatif
aux eaux limitrophes de 1909 qui engage chaque pays &agrave; ne pas laisser la 
pollution de ses eaux
nuire &agrave; l'autre. Le Trait&eacute; a cr&eacute;&eacute; un organe 
ind&eacute;pendant, la Commission mixte internationale,
charg&eacute; de voir &agrave; la protection des eaux limitrophes et de surveiller 
leur utilisation.<p>

Il est devenu essentiel vers le milieu du si&egrave;cle d'entreprendre une action 
concert&eacute;e pour
prot&eacute;ger les lacs. Les algues qui prolif&eacute;raient en se nourrissant du 
phosphore provenant des
d&eacute;tergents et des fertilisants &eacute;touffaient les lacs en aval et 
polluaient les plages. Le lac &Eacute;ri&eacute;, qui est
le moins profond, fut d&eacute;clar&eacute; mort par certains scientifiques. <p>

En 1972, les deux pays ont sign&eacute; le premier Accord relatif &agrave; la 
qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans les
Grands Lacs, qui visait avant tout &agrave; contr&ocirc;ler les quantit&eacute;s de 
phosphore et qui chargeait la
Commission mixte internationale de voir &agrave; sa mise en oeuvre. Les deux pays ont 
adopt&eacute; des lois et
des programmes de r&eacute;glementation en vue de restreindre l'utilisation du 
phosphore. De 1972 &agrave;
1987, le Canada a d&eacute;pens&eacute; 2 milliards $ et les &Eacute;tats-Unis un 
montant proportionnel pour la
construction et la modernisation d'usines d'&eacute;puration des eaux us&eacute;es 
dans le bassin. Les deux pays
ont adopt&eacute; des programmes agricoles visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire les apports 
de phosphore. Les r&eacute;sultats sont
&eacute;loquents :  les apports de phosphore provenant de sources municipales ou 
agricoles dans le lac
&Eacute;ri&eacute; ont diminu&eacute; de 70 % de 1975 &agrave; 1989, des plages ont 
&eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;ouvertes et certaines esp&egrave;ces de
poissons sont r&eacute;apparues. <p>

Au milieu des ann&eacute;es 1970, il devint de plus en plus clair que des produits 
chimiques
toxiques mena&ccedil;aient l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me des Grands Lacs. Certaines 
p&ecirc;ches commerciales furent
abandonn&eacute;es, et l'on conseilla de ne plus consommer certaines esp&egrave;ces de 
poissons de sport apr&egrave;s
la d&eacute;couverte de concentrations &eacute;lev&eacute;es de substances toxiques 
dans leur chair. L'on observa des
anomalies dans la fa&ccedil;on de se reproduire chez certains oiseaux se nourrissant 
de poissons, et la
population d'un certain nombre d'esp&egrave;ces chuta brusquement. <p>

En 1978, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont sign&eacute; un deuxi&egrave;me 
Accord relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de
l'eau dans les Grands Lacs, qui pr&eacute;cise que les Parties ont pour politique  
d'interdire les rejets de
substances toxiques en quantit&eacute;s reconnues toxiques et de t&acirc;cher 
d'&eacute;liminer les rejets de toutes les
substances toxiques r&eacute;manentes.  Les deux pays ont promis  de r&eacute;tablir 
et de conserver
l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; chimique, physique et biologique des eaux de 
l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me du bassin des Grands Lacs.  <p>

Le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont &eacute;labor&eacute; des programmes 
scientifiques et r&eacute;glementaires et
des programmes d'information importants sur les produits chimiques organiques et les 
m&eacute;taux. Un
certain nombre de produits chimiques ont &eacute;t&eacute; interdits ou 
limit&eacute;s. Ces efforts ont commenc&eacute; &agrave;
donner des r&eacute;sultats vers le d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1980 :<p>

<ul>
<li>Les r&eacute;sidus de produits chimiques organiques synth&eacute;tiques et de 
m&eacute;taux lourds se trouvant dans
les s&eacute;diments lacustres, o&ugrave; les substances toxiques r&eacute;manentes 
tendent &agrave; s'accumuler, affichaient
un d&eacute;clin. <p>

<li>Les quantit&eacute;s de PCB et de DDT trouv&eacute;es dans la truite de lac, l'une 
des principales esp&egrave;ces
pr&eacute;datrices de la cha&icirc;ne alimentaire, avaient diminu&eacute; 
consid&eacute;rablement. <p>

<li>La p&ecirc;che commerciale de dor&eacute; dans le lac &Eacute;ri&eacute; et le lac 
Ste-Claire, interdite en 1970 pour cause
de contamination au mercure, fut r&eacute;ouverte.<p>

<li>La situation commen&ccedil;a &agrave; se redresser pour la plupart des populations 
d'oiseaux du bassin.
</ul>
 <p>

Toutefois, la concentration de certains contaminants dans les s&eacute;diments, les 
poissons, la
faune et la flore a cess&eacute; de diminuer. En 1987, le Canada et les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis ont r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute; leur
engagement &agrave; &eacute;liminer les substances toxiques r&eacute;manentes dans un 
Protocole modifiant l'Accord
de 1978. Le Protocole pr&eacute;cise que des changements &agrave; 
l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; chimique, physique et biologique
des voies navigables des Grands Lacs commandent la d&eacute;signation de  secteurs 
pr&eacute;occupants  et
approuve l'&eacute;laboration de Plans d'action correctrice (PAC) en vue d'assainir 
les r&eacute;gions pollu&eacute;es.
(Quarante-trois secteurs pr&eacute;occupants ont &eacute;t&eacute; 
d&eacute;sign&eacute;s, dix-sept au Canada, dont cinq en bordure
des eaux limitrophes). Le Protocole pr&eacute;voit l'&eacute;laboration de Plans 
d'am&eacute;nagement panlacustre
pour chacun des lacs et accorde plus d'importance &agrave; la pollution par des 
substances a&eacute;roport&eacute;es,
aux eaux de ruissellement pollu&eacute;es, aux substances s'&eacute;coulant de 
d&eacute;charges de produits chimiques
toxiques et &agrave; la contamination des s&eacute;diments lacustres. <p>

Les deux pays, la province de l'Ontario et les &Eacute;tats en bordure des lacs ont 
depuis ce
temps conclu d'autres accords visant des probl&egrave;mes particuliers, par exemple :
<p>

<ul>
<li>En 1987, les gouvernements du Canada, des &Eacute;tats-Unis, de l'Ontario et de 
l'&Eacute;tat de New York
ont sign&eacute; une d&eacute;claration d'intention concernant la rivi&egrave;re 
Niagara, dont les eaux tr&egrave;s pollu&eacute;es
coulent du lac &Eacute;ri&eacute; au lac Ontario. Les deux pays s'engagent par cette 
entente &agrave; r&eacute;duire d'au moins
de moiti&eacute; les apports de produits chimiques toxiques provenant de sources 
ponctuelles et non
ponctuelles d'ici 1996. Dix produits chimiques toxiques ont &eacute;t&eacute; 
identifi&eacute;s &agrave; ce jour. Le Canada a
press&eacute; les &Eacute;tats-Unis, dont les rejets municipaux et industriels 
polluent consid&eacute;rablement la
rivi&egrave;re, de r&eacute;duire ces apports et d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer le 
nettoyage de ses sites d'enfouissement de produits
toxiques le long de la rivi&egrave;re.<p>

<li>En 1991, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis, ainsi que l'Ontario, le Michigan, le 
Minnesota et le
Wisconsin, se sont engag&eacute;s &agrave; assainir et &agrave; prot&eacute;ger le lac 
Sup&eacute;rieur, le plus grand et le plus pur
des Grands Lacs. Ils l'ont alors d&eacute;sign&eacute; comme un endroit o&ugrave; 
aucun rejet de substance toxique
provenant de source ponctuelle ne sera tol&eacute;r&eacute;.<p>

<li>Les deux gouvernements f&eacute;d&eacute;raux pr&eacute;parent, de concert avec 
l'Ontario et l'&Eacute;tat de New York,
un plan de gestion des substances toxiques pour le lac Ontario. Leur objectif est 
d'assainir
suffisamment le lac pour permettre aux &ecirc;tres humains d'en consommer sans 
restriction le poisson
et l'eau potable trait&eacute;e, et pour permettre aux poissons, &agrave; la faune et 
&agrave; la flore de s'y reproduire
naturellement. <p>

<h3>OBJECTIFS SEMBLABLES, SYST&Egrave;MES DIFF&Eacute;RENTS</h3>

Le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis partagent les m&ecirc;mes objectifs en ce qui 
concerne les Grands
Lacs, &agrave; savoir assainir les r&eacute;gions contamin&eacute;es, &eacute;liminer 
presque compl&egrave;tement les substances
toxiques r&eacute;manentes, pr&eacute;venir la pollution ainsi que prot&eacute;ger et 
remettre en bon &eacute;tat l'habitat des
poissons, de la faune et de la flore. N'ayant pas le m&ecirc;me syst&egrave;me 
gouvernemental, les deux pays
ont adopt&eacute; des approches diff&eacute;rentes pour atteindre leurs objectifs.<p>

Selon la Constitution canadienne, l'environnement est de comp&eacute;tence 
f&eacute;d&eacute;rale et
provinciale, et les deux paliers collaborent &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration des 
objectifs et des r&egrave;glements s'y
rapportant. La Loi canadienne sur la protection de l'environnement (LCPE) autorise le
gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral &agrave; &eacute;laborer et &agrave; appliquer des 
r&egrave;glements pour contr&ocirc;ler l'introduction, la
fabrication et l'&eacute;limination de certains produits chimiques comme le chlorure 
de vinyle, les PCB et
les CFC. Ces contr&ocirc;les peuvent &eacute;galement s'appliquer &agrave; d'autres 
substances toxiques prioritaires.
Le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral a d'importants pouvoirs de r&eacute;glementation 
en ce qui concerne les
produits de lutte antiparasitaire, les poissons et leur habitat, ainsi que la flore et 
la faune
transfronti&egrave;res. En vertu de la Loi sur les p&ecirc;ches, il &eacute;labore et 
applique des r&egrave;glements qui
interdisent les rejets de substances pouvant nuire aux poissons et contr&ocirc;le les 
effluents d'un certain
nombre de secteurs industriels. <p>

Les provinces contr&ocirc;lent le d&eacute;veloppement, la conservation et la gestion 
de leurs
ressources naturelles et ont d'importantes responsabilit&eacute;s pour ce qui est de 
la qualit&eacute; de l'eau, de
la flore et de la faune, de l'air et de l'utilisation des terres. Elles 
&eacute;laborent et appliquent des
r&egrave;glements industriels et municipaux, et r&eacute;glementent l'essentiel du 
transport, des rejets et de
l'&eacute;limination des d&eacute;chets sur leur territoire. Les gouvernements 
f&eacute;d&eacute;ral et provinciaux travaillent
de concert dans les secteurs de comp&eacute;tence partag&eacute;e, notamment ceux des 
papeti&egrave;res et des mines
de m&eacute;taux, et collaborent &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration de r&egrave;glements 
compl&eacute;mentaires. <p>

La coordination des efforts du gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral et de l'Ontario 
dans les dossiers
concernant les Grands Lacs est facilit&eacute;e par la tenue de consultations et la 
n&eacute;gociation d'accords
comme l'Entente Canada-Ontario relative &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans le 
Grands Lacs. Cet accord,
sign&eacute; en 1971 et renouvel&eacute; environ tous les cinq ans, pr&eacute;cise les 
responsabilit&eacute;s de chacun des
gouvernements en vertu de l'Accord relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans 
les Grands Lacs. La r&eacute;vision
actuelle des dossiers et des programmes facilitera la conclusion d'un nouvel accord 
appel&eacute; &agrave;
consolider la strat&eacute;gie f&eacute;d&eacute;rale-provinciale &agrave; 
l'&eacute;gard des Grands Lacs. Des ententes administratives
particuli&egrave;res entre les deux gouvernements permettent des coordonner la mise en 
application des
r&egrave;glements environnementaux comme le nouveau r&egrave;glement visant les 
papeti&egrave;res.<p>

Deux gouvernements f&eacute;d&eacute;raux, un provincial et huit gouvernements 
d'&Eacute;tat exer&ccedil;ant leur
autorit&eacute; dans le bassin des Grands Lacs, chacun selon leur propre cadre 
l&eacute;gislatif, il est difficile
d'&eacute;laborer une r&eacute;glementation parall&egrave;le et d'&eacute;tablir des 
lois &eacute;troitement compatibles dans les divers
domaines de comp&eacute;tence. L'approche que pr&eacute;f&egrave;re le Canada est de 
collaborer avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis
pour fixer des objectifs communs concernant la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans le bassin, 
puis d'&eacute;laborer,
chacun de son c&ocirc;t&eacute;, un programme r&eacute;glementaire en vue d'atteindre 
ces objectifs. L'Accord
canado-am&eacute;ricain sur la qualit&eacute; de l'air constitue un mod&egrave;le de 
coop&eacute;ration binationale flexible qui
pourrait &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute; aux Grands Lacs. Cet accord pr&eacute;voit que les 
deux pays doivent r&eacute;duire les
&eacute;missions causant les pluies acides, mais ne pr&eacute;cise pas comment ils s'y 
prendront.    <p>

<h3>MESURES CANADIENNES VISANT &Agrave; PROT&Eacute;GER LES GRANDS LACS</h3>

Les gouvernements du Canada et de l'Ontario ont mis sur pied un ensemble vaste et
complexe d'initiatives au profit du bassin des Grands Lacs. Un certain nombre de ces 
programmes
sont reli&eacute;s entre eux et beaucoup requi&egrave;rent la participation de groupes 
environnementaux et de
groupes de citoyens.<p>

<h4>Le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral</h4>

De 1972 &agrave; 1989, les d&eacute;penses f&eacute;d&eacute;rales dans le cadre du 
Programme concernant la qualit&eacute; de l'eau
dans les Grands Lacs se sont situ&eacute;es dans la fourchette de 12 &agrave; 25 
millions $ par ann&eacute;e. <p>

Le Plan d'action des Grands Lacs cr&eacute;&eacute; dans la foul&eacute;e du 
Protocole de 1987 modifiant
l'Accord relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans les Grands Lacs a fait 
doubl&eacute; les d&eacute;penses f&eacute;d&eacute;rales &agrave; ce
titre. Ce plan de cinq ans, entr&eacute; en vigueur en 1989, comprend un Programme de 
protection de 50
millions $, un Fonds d'assainissement de 55 millions $ et un programme intitul&eacute; 
Les Grands Lacs :
Impact sur la sant&eacute; de 20 millions $.<p>

Le Programme de protection vise &agrave; renverser  la contamination avanc&eacute;e 
du bassin
canadien des Grands Lacs par des produits chimiques toxiques. Il comporte six volets : 
la sant&eacute; de
l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me, la pollution de source terrestre, la pollution 
caus&eacute;e par la navigation, les s&eacute;diments
contamin&eacute;s, la contamination par des substances a&eacute;roport&eacute;es et 
les mesures correctrices. Le
programme inclut le Fonds de recherche universitaire des Grands Lacs, qui a permis 
d'accorder &agrave;
des chercheurs universitaires en 1990-1991 19 subventions totalisant environ 1 million 
$.<p>

L'&eacute;laboration des Plans d'action correctrice s'effectue dans le cadre du 
Programme de
protection. Des &eacute;quipes f&eacute;d&eacute;rales-provinciales &eacute;tablissent 
des plans pour les 17 secteurs
pr&eacute;occupants canadiens en collaboration avec les communaut&eacute;s locales. 
Tel que mentionn&eacute; dans
l'Annexe 2 de l'Accord relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans les Grands 
Lacs, les PAC doivent &ecirc;tre
r&eacute;alis&eacute;s en trois &eacute;tapes : l) d&eacute;finition des 
probl&egrave;mes et des sources; 2) s&eacute;lection des mesures
correctrices et des mesures de r&eacute;glementation; et 3) confirmation de 
l'efficacit&eacute; des mesures
correctrices et du retour &agrave; la normale de la situation en ce qui concerne les 
utilisations.<p>

En mars 1993, la phase 1 de 14 PAC avait &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;e et 
approuv&eacute;e par le Canada et
l'Ontario, et la phase 2 de 2 PAC concernant les ports de Collingwood et de Hamilton 
avait &eacute;t&eacute;
soumise aux ministres de l'Environnement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral et provincial.<p>

Les PAC sont mis en oeuvre gr&acirc;ce au Fonds d'assainissement, dont l'objectif est 
d'aider &agrave;
trouver des solutions techniques aux probl&egrave;mes touchant la qualit&eacute; de 
l'eau des secteurs
pr&eacute;occupants canadiens. En d&eacute;cembre 1992, 18 millions $ avaient 
d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s &agrave; 54 projets
visant &agrave; d&eacute;velopper et &agrave; pr&eacute;senter des technologies et des 
mesures correctrices &eacute;conomiques
s'appliquant aux domaines suivants : extraction et traitement des s&eacute;diments 
contamin&eacute;s,
optimisation du rendement des usines d'&eacute;puration des eaux us&eacute;es, 
am&eacute;lioration de la gestion des
eaux pluviales, r&eacute;habilitation et cr&eacute;ation d'habitats pour les poissons, 
la flore et la faune et
contr&ocirc;le de la pollution provenant de sources agricoles non ponctuelles. 
D'autres organismes
f&eacute;d&eacute;raux, provinciaux et municipaux, le secteur priv&eacute; et des 
groupes de pression ont affect&eacute; 31
million $ &agrave; ces projets.<p>

L'objectif du programme Les Grands Lacs : Impact sur l'environnement est de 
prot&eacute;ger la
population du bassin des Grands Lacs contre les effets sur la sant&eacute; d'une 
exposition aux
contaminants mena&ccedil;ant cette r&eacute;gion. Les quarante projets de recherche et 
de consultation
publique en cours visent &agrave; d&eacute;terminer la port&eacute;e et les 
r&eacute;percussions sur la sant&eacute; d'une exposition &agrave;
ces contaminants.<p>

Le Plan vert du Canada annonc&eacute; en d&eacute;cembre 1990 est un plan d'action 
environnemental
de grande port&eacute;e bas&eacute; sur le principe du d&eacute;veloppement durable. 
Le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral s'y
engage &agrave; d&eacute;penser 3 milliards $ suppl&eacute;mentaires sur une 
p&eacute;riode de six ans. Parce que les
probl&egrave;mes touchant l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me des Grands Lacs constituent une 
menace pour l'environnement
du Canada dans son ensemble, les programmes qui visent &agrave; le prot&eacute;ger 
sont per&ccedil;us comme des
mod&egrave;les sur lesquels devraient se fonder les objectifs nationaux du Plan vert. 
Parmi ces objectifs,
mentionnons l'assainissement de l'air et de l'eau, la protection des esp&egrave;ces et 
des espaces menac&eacute;s,
l'&eacute;limination des rejets de substances toxiques, la r&eacute;duction des 
d&eacute;chets et la conservation des
ressources renouvelables.<p>

Environ 20 % des ressources du Plan vert sont affect&eacute;es directement aux Grands 
Lacs.
L'Initiative de pr&eacute;vention de la pollution dans les Grands Lacs et le 
Saint-Laurent, d'une valeur de
25 millions $, a &eacute;t&eacute; le premier programme d'envergure annonc&eacute; 
dans le cadre du Plan vert. Elle
vise &agrave; &eacute;liminer les produits chimiques toxiques r&eacute;manents se 
trouvant dans le bassin en
encourageant tous les secteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; canadienne &agrave; se 
concentrer sur la pr&eacute;vention. Cette
Initiative comporte trois programmes : le Programme bilat&eacute;ral de restauration 
et de protection du
lac Sup&eacute;rieur, plan d'action &eacute;labor&eacute; conjointement avec 
l'Ontario, le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral
am&eacute;ricain et les gouvernements des &Eacute;tats afin de pr&eacute;server 
l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; du plus grand et du moins
pollu&eacute; des grands lacs; le Centre de pr&eacute;vention de la pollution dans les 
Grands Lacs, centre
d'information et de sensibilisation aux questions de pr&eacute;vention de la 
pollution, qui a ouvert ses
portes &agrave; Sarnia (Ontario) en mai 1992; et des projets facultatifs de 
pr&eacute;vention de la pollution
s'appliquant &agrave; divers secteurs industriels. En mai 1992, les gouvernements du 
Canada et de
l'Ontario ainsi que les entreprises membres de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; des fabricants 
de v&eacute;hicules &agrave; moteur ont
sign&eacute; un accord pr&eacute;voyant la r&eacute;duction des substances toxiques 
employ&eacute;es, g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;es et rejet&eacute;es
par les constructeurs automobiles. <p>

D'autres programmes du Plan vert d'envergure nationale pr&eacute;sentent des 
avantages
particuliers pour le bassin des Grands Lacs. Par exemple, quelque 600 000 $ ont 
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s &agrave;
l'&eacute;largissement de la port&eacute;e de la Loi sur les p&ecirc;ches et des 
r&egrave;glements d'application de la LCPE en
Ontario. Des ressources consid&eacute;rables ont &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; 
affect&eacute;es &agrave; la pr&eacute;vention des
d&eacute;versements accidentels, &agrave; la planification et &agrave; l'intervention 
d'urgence ainsi qu'&agrave; la gestion des
d&eacute;chets provenant des PCB et des CFC. <p>

La nouvelle r&eacute;glementation f&eacute;d&eacute;rale concernant les 
papeti&egrave;res, entr&eacute;e en vigueur en
d&eacute;cembre 1992, touche 26 usines du bassin des Grands Lacs. Elle a 
&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;labor&eacute;e &agrave; la suite
d'importantes consultations publiques et en coordination avec l'Ontario, qui  a 
publi&eacute; r&eacute;cemment
sa propre r&eacute;glementation pour ce secteur (voir page ---). Il s'agit de la 
premi&egrave;re r&eacute;glementation
nationale au monde qui vise &agrave; pr&eacute;venir la formation et 
l'&eacute;chappement de dioxines et de furannes
tr&egrave;s toxiques. On envisage en outre de renforcer la r&eacute;glementation 
portant sur le secteur minier et
d'adopter en 1993 une nouvelle r&eacute;glementation r&eacute;gissant l'importation et 
l'exportation  des
produits chimiques toxiques sous le r&eacute;gime de la LCPE. <p>

Le Canada cherche, en collaboration  avec l'Ontario et les grands de l'industrie
, 
&agrave; interdire
ou &agrave; &eacute;liminer progressivement d'autres produits chimiques toxiques par 
la voie du programme
facultatif  Acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration de la r&eacute;duction des substances toxiques 
pour l'environnement .    <p>

L'Inventaire national des rejets polluants, base de donn&eacute;es des polluants 
dangereux &eacute;tablie
sur le mod&egrave;le de l'United States Toxic Release Inventory, devrait &ecirc;tre 
compl&eacute;t&eacute; en 1994. Il
portera sur des substances particuli&egrave;res potentiellement nocives pour 
l'environnement et la sant&eacute;
utilis&eacute;es en grande quantit&eacute;. <p>

<h4>Ontario</h4>

La province r&eacute;glemente la quantit&eacute; de polluants que les &eacute;gouts 
industriels et municipaux peuvent
d&eacute;verser dans ses eaux navigables &agrave; l'aide d'ordonnances de 
r&eacute;glementation, de certificats
d'approbation et de lignes directrices provinciales sur la qualit&eacute; des 
effluents.<p>

Le Programme des promesses de pr&eacute;vention de la pollution de l'Ontario est une 
nouvelle
initiative visant &agrave; encourager les entreprises &agrave; &eacute;laborer leur 
propre plan de pr&eacute;vention de la
pollution et &agrave; s'engager &agrave; r&eacute;duire leurs &eacute;missions de 
polluants. La province a fix&eacute; des objectifs
moyens pour la r&eacute;duction des rejets de certains chimiques et d&eacute;chets aux 
installations
participantes, soit 50 % d'ici 1995 et 90 % d'ici l'an 2000.<p>

La Strat&eacute;gie municipale et industrielle de d&eacute;pollution (SMID) de 
l'Ontario vise &agrave; &eacute;liminer
presque totalement les rejets de contaminants toxiques r&eacute;manents provenant de 
tous les &eacute;gouts
industriels et municipaux. Sa premi&egrave;re phase, qui comprend la surveillance 
normalis&eacute;e des rejets
de l'industrie, est termin&eacute;e.   <p>

La province a publi&eacute; deux projets de r&egrave;glement, premiers d'une 
s&eacute;rie de r&egrave;glements devant
permettre de contr&ocirc;ler rigoureusement la qualit&eacute; de l'eau provenant des 
raffineries de p&eacute;trole et
des papeti&egrave;res dans le cadre de la SMID. Les r&egrave;glements touchant le 
secteur p&eacute;trolier, qui seront
les plus stricts en Am&eacute;rique du Nord, devraient imposer aux raffineries de 
r&eacute;duire de 30 % leurs
rejets de polluants dans les voies navigables de l'Ontario. Les contr&ocirc;les 
viseront 11 substances, la
pr&eacute;sence de dioxines et de furanes dans les eaux us&eacute;es sera 
compl&egrave;tement interdite et les montants
d'ammoniaque, de phosphore, de p&eacute;trole et de solides en suspension seront 
limit&eacute;s. Les
r&egrave;glements toucheront sept raffineries de p&eacute;trole, toutes situ&eacute;es 
dans le bassin des Grands Lacs. <p>

Le r&egrave;glement visant les papeti&egrave;res adopt&eacute; en f&eacute;vrier 1993 
cible toute une gamme de
substances dont les organochlor&eacute;s, famille de produits chimiques &agrave; base 
de chlore incluant des
agents canc&eacute;rig&egrave;nes connus. Ces papeti&egrave;res sont responsables de 
90 % des rejets d'organochlor&eacute;s
dans les Grands Lacs et dans d'autres voies navigables de l'Ontario. Le 
r&egrave;glement exigera que
l'industrie &eacute;labore un plan pour mettre un terme &agrave; son utilisation de 
chlore et aidera grandement
l'Ontario &agrave; atteindre son objectif d'&eacute;limination totale des rejets 
d'organochlor&eacute;s d'ici l'an 2002.
L'Ontario envisage d'adopter des r&egrave;glements visant l'assainissement de l'eau 
dans sept autres
secteurs, y compris les mines, les produits chimiques organiques, le fer et l'acier.<p>

<h4>Municipalit&eacute;s</h4>

Depuis le milieu des ann&eacute;es 1950, les divers paliers de gouvernement du 
c&ocirc;t&eacute; canadien des Grands
Lacs ont affect&eacute; plusieurs milliards de dollars &agrave; des syst&egrave;mes 
municipaux de collecte et de
traitement des eaux us&eacute;es. Les syst&egrave;mes de traitement sont 
continuellement modernis&eacute;s afin de
satisfaire &agrave; des exigences de plus en plus strictes.<p>

Les municipalit&eacute;s du bassin participent &agrave; un certain nombre 
d'initiatives f&eacute;d&eacute;rales et
provinciales. Par exemple, Environnement Canada, la province de l'Ontario et la 
municipalit&eacute; de
Hamilton-Wentworth collaborent, dans le cadre de l'Initiative de pr&eacute;vention de 
la pollution dans
les Grands Lacs, &agrave; un projet dont l'objectif est d'&eacute;liminer les 
d&eacute;chets dangereux g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par les
petites industries comme les nettoyeurs, les stations-service et les laboratoires de 
photo. Le projet
se d&eacute;roule en coordination avec un projet semblable du Erie County de 
l'&Eacute;tat de New York, dans
le cadre d'efforts bilat&eacute;raux pour r&eacute;duire la pollution dans le lac 
Ontario. Le programme Plan
d'action communautaire est une autre initiative du Plan vert visant &agrave; aider les 
municipalit&eacute;s du
bassin des Grands Lacs &agrave; axer leur planification environnementale sur la 
pr&eacute;vention de la
pollution.<p>

<h4>Industries</h4>

Les industries canadiennes ont d&eacute;pens&eacute; des centaines de millions de 
dollars pour r&eacute;duire les rejets
de m&eacute;taux, de p&eacute;trole et de produits chimiques dans les lacs. Les 
entreprises de la  vall&eacute;e
chimique   du Canada situ&eacute;es le long de la rivi&egrave;re Ste-Claire ont 
notamment d&eacute;pens&eacute; ou affect&eacute;
plus de 120 millions $ dans le but de r&eacute;duire leurs rejets de polluants dans la 
rivi&egrave;re. Par exemple,
le plus important producteur de produits chimiques organiques de la r&eacute;gion, Dow 
Chemical of
Canada Inc., a r&eacute;duit de 98 % ses rejets de polluants majeurs et esp&egrave;re 
&eacute;liminer presque
compl&egrave;tement ses d&eacute;versements et ses rejets nocifs dans la 
rivi&egrave;re d'ici l'an 2000.<p>

<h3>VERS UN BUT COMMUN</h3>

Au cours des derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont 
pris des mesures en vue de
r&eacute;gler une s&eacute;rie de crises impliquant la pollution des Grands Lacs et 
ont r&eacute;ussi &agrave; r&eacute;duire ou &agrave;
&eacute;liminer un grand nombre des pires sources de contaminants .<p>

Des probl&egrave;mes urgents subsistent toutefois, et une strat&eacute;gie  plus 
vaste semble n&eacute;cessaire
pour les ann&eacute;es 1990, strat&eacute;gie bas&eacute;e sur la pr&eacute;vent
ion de 
la pollution et sur la restauration
acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute;e de la qualit&eacute; de l'eau.<p>

Le succ&egrave;s de cette strat&eacute;gie d&eacute;pendra en bout de ligne de la 
solidit&eacute; du partenariat et de la
collaboration continus entre le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ainsi que de la 
participation active de tous
les paliers de gouvernement, des citoyens et de l'industrie des deux 
c&ocirc;t&eacute;s de la fronti&egrave;re.

<blockquote> ...les substances toxiques r&eacute;manentes pr&eacute;sentes dans l'environnement 
des Grands Lacs menacent
&eacute;galement la sant&eacute; humaine. Il serait peu judicieux et imprudent de 
tarder &agrave; agir</blockquote>. 

<p>
<i>Commission mixte internationale, Cinqui&egrave;me rapport biennal, 1989</i>
<p>

Sant&eacute; et Bien-&Ecirc;tre social Canada r&eacute;alise actuellement un vaste 
programme d'une dur&eacute;e de cinq
ans visant l'acquisition de nouvelles connaissances scientifiques relatives aux effets 
des substances
toxiques r&eacute;manentes sur la sant&eacute; des Canadiens vivant dans le bassin des 
Grands Lacs. <p>

Le Programme Les Grands Lacs - Impacts sur la sant&eacute;, mis en oeuvre en janvier 
1990, permettra
d'&eacute;valuer l'impact des contaminants sur la sant&eacute; des &ecirc;tres 
humains, de d&eacute;terminer quelles
personnes sont les plus vuln&eacute;rables et d'&eacute;laborer des strat&eacute;gies 
visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire les risques pour la
sant&eacute;. Le programme a pour but, notamment, d'&eacute;tablir des partenariats 
entre des organismes
gouvernementaux, le secteur priv&eacute;, des groupes vou&eacute;s &agrave; la 
protection de l'environnement et des
particuliers afin de travailler &agrave; la r&eacute;duction de la contamination du 
bassin et &agrave; la promotion de la
sant&eacute;.<p>

Ce programme de 20 millions de dollars s'inscrit dans le Plan d'action des Grands 
Lacs, lequel a
&eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;u en r&eacute;ponse au protocole de 1987 sur l'Accord de 
1978 relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans
les Grands Lacs. Il repose sur des &eacute;tudes &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques 
ant&eacute;rieures et sur un projet
interorganisme dans le cadre duquel ont &eacute;t&eacute; recueillies des 
donn&eacute;es sur les niveaux de substances
toxiques r&eacute;manentes pr&eacute;sentes dans le bassin des Grands Lacs et sur les 
effets nocifs de ces
substances.<p>

<h3>FAITS CONNUS</h3>


Les chercheurs ont d&eacute;couvert plus de 350 produits chimiques dans 
l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me des Grands Lacs.
Depuis les ann&eacute;es 60, de nombreuses &eacute;tudes en laboratoire et sur le 
terrain ont fait &eacute;tat des effets
de l'exposition des animaux &agrave; ces produits. On a observ&eacute; chez quatorze 
esp&egrave;ces, dont la truite de
lac, le cormoran, la sterne, l'aigle &agrave; t&ecirc;te blanche, le vison et la 
tortue hargneuse, des probl&egrave;mes de
reproduction et une baisse de la population. Le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont 
interdit ou restreint
l'utilisation de pesticides organochlor&eacute;s, de PCB et de mercure. Il en est 
r&eacute;sult&eacute; une diminution
consid&eacute;rable des niveaux de contaminants dans les Grands Lacs et, par ricochet, 
une augmentation
de la population de certaines esp&egrave;ces. N&eacute;anmoins, bon nombre de 
substances toxiques
extr&ecirc;mement r&eacute;manentes continuent d'exercer leur effet nuisible sur 
l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me apr&egrave;s la
disparition de leur cause.<p>

Comparativement &agrave; ce que l'on sait des effets que produit sur le poisson et le 
gibier l'exposition &agrave;
long terme &agrave; des m&eacute;taux et &agrave; des produits chimiques toxiques, les 
r&eacute;percussions sur la sant&eacute; des
personnes expos&eacute;es &agrave; ces substances sont moins connues. Certes, des 
chercheurs, aussi bien au
Canada qu'aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, ont r&eacute;alis&eacute; de nombreuses &eacute;tudes 
sur ce sujet, mais le fait qu'il n'existe
pas de programme complet de surveillance &agrave; long terme ni de banque de tissus 
humains les a
emp&ecirc;ch&eacute;s de tirer des conclusions d&eacute;finitives quant aux effets de 
cette exposition sur la sant&eacute; des
personnes. Le Programme Les Grands Lacs   Impacts sur la sant&eacute; a 
&eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;u pour combler ces
lacunes.<p>

L'&ecirc;tre humain fait partie de l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me des Grands Lacs, 
puisqu'il se situe au sommet du r&eacute;seau
alimentaire. Selon les chercheurs, les contaminants des Grands Lacs auxquels sont 
expos&eacute;es les
personnes se trouvent, dans une proportion de 80 &agrave; 90 %, dans la nourriture 
qu'elles consomment,
surtout dans certains poissons et gibiers, plut&ocirc;t que dans l'air ou dans l'eau. 
De nombreuses
substances toxiques r&eacute;manentes sont liposolubles et s'accumulent pour former 
des concentrations
de plus en plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es &agrave; mesure qu'elles s'acheminent vers le 
sommet du r&eacute;seau alimentaire. On
peut d&eacute;terminer l'exposition des personnes &agrave; des produits chimiques 
toxiques en calculant la
concentration d'un contaminant donn&eacute; dans les tissus, en particulier le tissu 
adipeux.<p>

On a constat&eacute; la pr&eacute;sence de substances toxiques dans des 
&eacute;chantillons de tissu pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s sur des
r&eacute;sidents de la r&eacute;gion des Grands Lacs (quoique les niveaux 
enregistr&eacute;s ne soient pas sup&eacute;rieurs &agrave;
ceux que l'on a observ&eacute;s chez des personnes vivant dans d'autres r&eacute;gions 
industrielles). Une &eacute;tude
en cours de r&eacute;alisation au Michigan a permis d'&eacute;tablir un lien entre 
l'exposition &agrave; des produits
chimiques pr&eacute;sents dans les Grands Lacs et certains probl&egrave;mes de 
d&eacute;veloppement. En effet, des
enfants n&eacute;s de femmes ayant mang&eacute; r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement pendant 
leur grossesse du poisson p&ecirc;ch&eacute; dans
le lac Michigan avaient &agrave; la naissance un poids et un p&eacute;rim&egrave;tre 
cr&acirc;nien inf&eacute;rieurs &agrave; la moyenne.
Lorsque ces enfants ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis &agrave; des tests, &agrave; 
l'&acirc;ge de quatre ans, on a constat&eacute; qu'un nombre
statistiquement significatif d'entre eux avaient une plus faible capacit&eacute; de 
s'exprimer verbalement
et une moins bonne m&eacute;moire. Il ne s'agit-l&agrave; que de r&eacute;sultats 
pr&eacute;liminaires, et des recherches plus
pouss&eacute;es sont n&eacute;cessaires afin de d&eacute;terminer si ces effets sur le 
d&eacute;veloppement sont attribuables
aux contaminants de l'environnement.<p>

<h3>PROJETS RELATIFS &Agrave; LA SANT&Eacute; EN COURS DE R&Eacute;ALISATION</h3>

Le Programme Les Grands Lacs   Impacts sur la sant&eacute; appuie plus de 40 projets 
dont bon nombre
sont interreli&eacute;s ou associ&eacute;s &agrave; des &eacute;tudes 
parall&egrave;les effectu&eacute;es aux &Eacute;tats-Unis. Si de nombreux
contaminants sont examin&eacute;s dans le cadre du programme, onze d'entre eux, 
d&eacute;sign&eacute;s par la
Commission mixte internationale comme &eacute;tant des  polluants dangereux  parce 
qu'ils demeurent
longtemps dans l'environnement, font l'objet des recherches les plus pouss&eacute;es.  
On accorde
&eacute;galement une attention particuli&egrave;re aux groupes de personnes qui 
semblent le plus expos&eacute;es aux
contaminants. Ce sont notamment celles qui consomment de grandes quantit&eacute;s de 
poisson et de
gibier de la r&eacute;gion des Grands Lacs, par exemple les p&ecirc;cheurs amateurs et 
leur famille, les
Autochtones, les r&eacute;sidents des zones tr&egrave;s industrialis&eacute;es et les 
enfants, dont la consommation de
nourriture par rapport &agrave; leur poids corporel est plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e que 
celle des adultes. Voici
quelques-uns des projets qui sont actuellement en cours de r&eacute;alisation.<p>

<h4>&Eacute;pid&eacute;miologie</h4>

(Les &eacute;tudes r&eacute;alis&eacute;es dans le cadre de ce projet traitent des 
effets de l'exposition &agrave; des
contaminants sur la fr&eacute;quence de la maladie et des malformations 
cong&eacute;nitales dans la r&eacute;gion.)<p>

<ul>
<li
>P&ecirc;cheurs amateurs de l'Ontario   Examine les effets nocifs de la consommation 
d'une grande
quantit&eacute; de poisson et de gibier provenant du bassin des Grands Lacs au moyen 
d'un questionnaire
envoy&eacute; par la poste &agrave; 4 000 d&eacute;tenteurs d'un permis de p&ecirc;che 
sportive en Ontario.<p>

<li>Hospitalisations pour maladies respiratoires   Compare les hospitalisations pour 
maladies
respiratoires avec les niveaux ambiants de pollution atmosph&eacute;rique dans le 
bassin des Grands Lacs
afin de d&eacute;terminer si les premi&egrave;res peuvent &ecirc;tre li&eacute;es aux 
seconds.<p>

<li>Malformations cong&eacute;nitales   Recueil pr&eacute;sentant, comt&eacute; par 
comt&eacute;, la fr&eacute;quence de malformations
cong&eacute;nitales de 1980 &agrave; 1986 en Ontario.
</ul>

<p>

<h4>Toxicologie</h4>


(Les &eacute;tudes r&eacute;alis&eacute;es dans le cadre de ce projet traitent des 
effets de l'exposition &agrave; des
contaminants sur le d&eacute;veloppement, la reproduction, les tissus humains, le 
syst&egrave;me immunitaire et
les processus biochimiques.)<p>

<ul>

<li>Reproduction --  &Eacute;value, chez les animaux et les &ecirc;tres humains, les effets 
de polluants dangereux
des Grands Lacs sur les ovaires, les ovules, le sperme et le d&eacute;veloppement 
embryonnaire.<p>

<li>Cong&eacute;n&egrave;res des PCB   Examine, chez les animaux, les effets de sept 
substances toxiques
appartenant &agrave; la famille des PCB sur la croissance de tumeurs, les substances 
chimiques du
cerveau, le comportement n&eacute;onatal et le d&eacute;veloppement. Cette 
&eacute;tude est reli&eacute;e &agrave; des travaux de
recherche effectu&eacute;s sur le m&ecirc;me sujet aux &Eacute;tats-Unis et en 
Su&egrave;de.<p>

<li>Base de donn&eacute;es sur la reproduction   En collaboration avec la U.S. 
Environmental Protection
Agency, des chercheurs canadiens enrichissent la base de donn&eacute;es scientifiques 
relatives aux effets
des produits chimiques sur la reproduction et le d&eacute;veloppement pr&eacute;natal.
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Surveillance</h4>

(Les &eacute;tudes r&eacute;alis&eacute;es dans le cadre de ce projet visent &agrave; 
mesurer le degr&eacute; d'exposition des
r&eacute;sidents du bassin des Grands Lacs &agrave; des m&eacute;taux et &agrave; des 
substances chimiques toxiques
r&eacute;manentes.)<p>

<ul>

<li
>Banque de tissu humain   La faisabilit&eacute; de constituer et de tenir &agrave; jour 
une banque de tissu humain
afin de d&eacute;tecter la pr&eacute;sence de polluants a &eacute;t&eacute; 
&eacute;tablie, et des &eacute;chantillons de tissu ont &eacute;t&eacute; 
pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s
afin d'&ecirc;tre conserv&eacute;s.<p>

<li>Pr&eacute;sence d'organochlor&eacute;s dans les poissons et le lait maternel   Des 
&eacute;chantillons de lait maternel
pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s chez des femmes vivant dans le bassin des Grands Lacs sont 
soumis &agrave; des tests afin de
d&eacute;terminer la pr&eacute;sence de PCB et d'autres contaminants et de faire des 
comparaisons avec des
&eacute;chantillons provenant de Canadiennes d'autres r&eacute;gions.<p>

<li>Projet E.A.G.L.E.   &Eacute;tudie le degr&eacute; d'exposition des Autochtones aux 
contaminants de
l'environnement et les risques que ceux-ci repr&eacute;sentent pour la sant&eacute; de 
ces Autochtones.
</ul>
<p>

<h4>Coordination et consultation</h4>


Plusieurs projets portent sur la coordination des activit&eacute;s des 
autorit&eacute;s f&eacute;d&eacute;rales dans le domaine
de la sant&eacute; avec celles d'autres organismes du Canada, des provinces et des 
&Eacute;tats-Unis. Par
exemple, des chercheurs m&eacute;dicaux conseillent un groupe de travail binational 
charg&eacute; de fixer des
objectifs &eacute;cosyst&eacute;miques pour le lac Ontario et collaborent avec les 
&eacute;quipes qui travaillent &agrave;
l'&eacute;laboration de plans d'assainissement des zones critiques.<p>

Un des buts principaux du Programme Les Grands Lacs - Impacts sur la sant&eacute; est 
de sensibiliser le
grand public aux questions relatives &agrave; la sant&eacute; propres aux Grands Lacs 
et de fournir des conseils
en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute; aux collectivit&eacute;s et aux personnes vivant 
dans le bassin. &Agrave; l'issue de
consultations qui avaient pour but de d&eacute;terminer les pr&eacute;occupations de 
la population en mati&egrave;re
de sant&eacute;, des ateliers ont &eacute;t&eacute; organis&eacute;s et des 
publications et des vid&eacute;os ont &eacute;t&eacute; diffus&eacute;es.<p>

<h3>PROMOUVOIR UN &Eacute;COSYST&Egrave;ME SAIN</h3>


Le Programme Les Grands Lacs - Impacts sur la sant&eacute; devrait permettre de 
combler un certain
nombre de lacunes au chapitre de la compr&eacute;hension scientifique des effets des 
polluants de
l'environnement sur la sant&eacute; des personnes. Les travaux de recherche 
r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans le cadre du
programme, ainsi que d'autres donn&eacute;es recueillies ailleurs dans le monde, 
servent &agrave; la r&eacute;vision des
lignes directrices canadiennes en mati&egrave;re d'eau potable, de consommation de 
poisson et de qualit&eacute;
de l'eau et de l'air ainsi qu'&agrave; l'&eacute;tablissement d'objectifs 
&eacute;cosyst&eacute;miques.<p>

On sait d&eacute;j&agrave; de fa&ccedil;on certaine que les m&eacute;taux et les 
produits chimiques toxiques constituent une
menace pour l'&eacute;cosyst&egrave;me dans son ensemble et que les niveaux de 
polluants doivent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;duits
consid&eacute;rablement. Le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral et l'Ontario unissent 
leurs efforts en vue d'atteindre
l'objectif qui a &eacute;t&eacute; fix&eacute; avec les &Eacute;tats-Unis dans le 
cadre du Protocole de 1987 sur l'Accord de
1978 relatif &agrave; la qualit&eacute; de l'eau dans les Grands Lacs, 
c'est-&agrave;-dire l'&eacute;limination virtuelle des
produits chimiques r&eacute;manents pr&eacute;sents dans les Grands Lacs.<p>

<h4>Guide pour la consommation du poisson gibier de l'Ontario</h4>

Le Programme d'analyse du poisson gibier de l'Ontario est le programme de surveillance 
et
d'information le plus vaste en son genre. Depuis 1970, on a soumis &agrave; des tests 
le poisson de plus
de 1 600 endroits dans la province afin de d&eacute;tecter la pr&eacute;sence de 
contaminants, dont le mercure
et d'autres m&eacute;taux, les PCB, le mirex, le DDT, la dioxine et le furanne. Les 
r&eacute;sultats de ces tests
figurent dans le Guide pour la consommation de poisson gibier de l'Ontario, 
publi&eacute; conjointement
par le minist&egrave;re de l'Environnement et de l'&Eacute;nergie et le 
minist&egrave;re des Richesses naturelles de
l'Ontario. Le guide contient des conseils en mati&egrave;re de consommation pour 
diverses esp&egrave;ces et
tailles de poisson. Ces conseils sont fond&eacute;s sur les lignes directrices 
&eacute;tablies par des m&eacute;decins
sp&eacute;cialistes de Sant&eacute; et Bien-&Ecirc;tre social Canada.

INSTALLING WARP ON A SYSTEM WITH FUTURE DOMAIN 1680, FIRST PHASE HANG WITH A BLINKING CURSOR.  NO LOGO ON THE FIRST REBOOT
</h3>
Last updated: 27 Dec 1994
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    Installing WARP on a system with Future Domain 1680 SCSI
    controller and Toshiba 3401b CDROM, hang after the first reboot
    with a blinking cursor on the top left hand corner.  No logo,
    just a black screen with blinking cursor. This is on a 1.5gb
    Maxtor hardfile.

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    User has low-level formatted the hardfile under the Future Domain
    utilities, but did not partition the drive and high-level
    format under this utilities.  The Maxtor drive cylinders set is
    incorrect, showing 816 instead of actual 1014 cylinders.  The
    hardfile was NOT correctly defined previously therefore causing
    this problem.

</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    Make sure the hardfile is correctly define and format under the
    Future Domain Utilities to avoid this problem.

<center><h2>N&Eacute;GOCIATIONS DU TRAIT&Eacute; SUR LE SAUMON DU PACIFIQUE :<br>
LA POSITION DU CANADA</h2></center>
<hr>
<p>

Le Canada est d&eacute;termin&eacute; &agrave; conserver et &agrave; g&eacute;rer 
rationnellement le saumon du Pacifique,
objectif qu'il s'est donn&eacute; en signant en 1985 le Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du 
Pacifique.  Cependant, le
Trait&eacute; n'est jamais totalement entr&eacute; en vigueur.  Les r&eacute;centes 
n&eacute;gociations pour &eacute;tablir des
arrangements &agrave; long terme en mati&egrave;re de p&ecirc;che et faire en sorte 
que chaque pays jouisse
pleinement de sa production de saumon - le principe d'&eacute;quit&eacute; du 
Trait&eacute; - sont m&ecirc;me rompues.<p>

En 1985, les deux parties se sont engag&eacute;es &agrave; mettre en oeuvre le 
principe d'&eacute;quit&eacute; ainsi
que des mesures de conservation.  La question de l'&eacute;quit&eacute; est 
pr&eacute;occupante pour le Canada, parce
que les &Eacute;tats-Unis r&eacute;coltent beaucoup plus de saumons canadiens que le 
Canada de saumons
am&eacute;ricains.  Depuis la signature du Trait&eacute;, les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont 
accru de 50 % leurs interceptions de
poisson canadien, alors que le Canada a r&eacute;duit les siennes de presque 40 %.  Ce 
d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre, ou
in&eacute;quit&eacute;, en faveur des &Eacute;tats-Unis se chiffre actuellement 
&agrave; 50 millions de dollars US par an.  Qui
plus est, les r&eacute;centes propositions des &Eacute;tats-Unis l'accentueraient 
encore.  Les &Eacute;tats-Unis veulent
en effet doubler les interceptions de saumon rouge du Fraser dans l'&Eacute;tat de 
Washington et en
Alaska, et refusent de mettre en place en Alaska des mesures de conservation pour 
prot&eacute;ger le
saumon coho canadien.  En m&ecirc;me temps, ils insistent pour que le Canada 
r&eacute;duise ses prises de
saumons cohos et quinnats originaires des &Eacute;tats de Washington et d'Oregon.<p>

Le Canada est encore d&eacute;termin&eacute; &agrave; conclure un accord &agrave; 
long terme pour la gestion du
saumon du Pacifique et d&eacute;sireux de coop&eacute;rer, comme il l'a fait par le 
pass&eacute;, pour conserver les
stocks de saumon en p&eacute;ril dans l'&Eacute;tat de Washington et en Oregon, en 
&eacute;change d'une coop&eacute;ration
similaire de la part des &Eacute;tats-Unis pour aider &agrave; conserver, dans le nord 
de la
Colombie-Britannique, les remontes de saumon coho canadien, qui sont en d&eacute;clin. 
 Le Canada
n'est cependant pas pr&ecirc;t &agrave; signer une entente qui ne r&egrave;glerait pas 
le grave d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre actuel.<p>


<h3>LE TRAIT&Eacute; SUR LE SAUMON DU PACIFIQUE</h3>


Le Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du Pacifique a &eacute;t&eacute; n&eacute;goci&eacute; 
pour r&eacute;agir au d&eacute;clin des stocks de saumon
quinnat au Canada et aux &Eacute;tats-Unis.  Il fournit une tribune de 
coop&eacute;ration en mati&egrave;re de gestion
et d'am&eacute;lioration des p&ecirc;ches, ainsi que de recherche sur le sujet.<p>


Si la gestion de la ressource que sont les saumons doit faire l'objet d'une 
collaboration
internationale, c'est en raison de leur cycle biologique unique.  En effet, ces 
poissons naissent dans
les eaux douces de fleuves et de rivi&egrave;res, migrent sur des centaines, voire des 
milliers de
kilom&egrave;tres jusqu'&agrave; la mer, o&ugrave; ils atteignent la maturit&eacute;.  
Apr&egrave;s une p&eacute;riode dont la dur&eacute;e varie de
un &agrave; sept ans selon l'esp&egrave;ce et le stock, ils reviennent pour frayer 
dans les eaux o&ugrave; ils sont n&eacute;s.<p>

Les p&ecirc;cheurs des &Eacute;tats-Unis interceptent souvent le saumon qui revient 
vers les cours d'eau
canadiens, et les p&ecirc;cheurs canadiens font de m&ecirc;me pour le saumon 
am&eacute;ricain.  Comme ces
poissons sont souvent captur&eacute;s &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur de leur pays 
d'origine, la bonne gestion des stocks et
la pr&eacute;vention de la surp&ecirc;che exigent la collaboration des deux nations.  
Il faut en outre &eacute;quilibrer
les interceptions pour que les deux pays puissent pleinement recueillir les bienfaits 
des efforts
qu'ils d&eacute;ploient pour maintenir ou augmenter les stocks de saumon.<p>

Le Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du Pacifique concerne cinq esp&egrave;ces de saumon 
(quinnat, k&eacute;ta, coho, rose
et rouge) qui fr&eacute;quentent les eaux des deux pays au cours de leurs migrations.  
Il &eacute;tablit deux
principes : la conservation, pour pr&eacute;venir la surp&ecirc;che et maximiser la 
production, et l'&eacute;quit&eacute;, pour
que chaque pays re&ccedil;oive pour ses p&ecirc;ches des b&eacute;n&eacute;fices 
&eacute;quivalents au rendement obtenu des
saumons originaires de ses eaux.<p>

Le Trait&eacute; reconna&icirc;t que chaque pays est responsable au premier chef de la 
gestion du poisson
originaire de ses eaux.  On y pr&eacute;cise que la gestion des p&ecirc;ches doit 
prendre en compte les
variations annuelles des niveaux des stocks de poisson, et la 
d&eacute;sirabilit&eacute; de r&eacute;duire les
interceptions et d'&eacute;viter de perturber de fa&ccedil;on indue les 
activit&eacute;s de p&ecirc;che existantes.<p>

Le Trait&eacute; d&eacute;finissait des r&eacute;gimes de gestion pour les principales 
p&ecirc;ches d'interception des deux
pays, et ce pour des p&eacute;riodes variant de deux &agrave; huit ans.  Il 
cr&eacute;ait en outre la Commission du
saumon du Pacifique, charg&eacute;e d'&eacute;tablir des ententes de p&ecirc;che pour 
les stocks de saumon
susceptibles d'&ecirc;tre intercept&eacute;s, d'am&eacute;liorer la conservation tout 
en limitant les interceptions et de
faire en sorte que chaque partie re&ccedil;oive le plein b&eacute;n&eacute;fice de sa 
production de saumon.<p>

Le Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du Pacifique n'a pas atteint tous ses objectifs.  
Malgr&eacute; la mise en place de
certaines mesures de conservation, les interceptions de saumon canadien par les 
&Eacute;tats-Unis,
comme on l'a mentionn&eacute;, ont consid&eacute;rablement augment&eacute;, passant de 
six &agrave; neuf millions
d'individus par ann&eacute;e.  La presque totalit&eacute; des nouvelles interceptions 
a eu lieu dans les p&ecirc;ches de
l'Alaska, qui ont accru de presque 90 % leurs prises de poisson canadien.  Par 
ailleurs, le Canada a
r&eacute;duit ses activit&eacute;s de p&ecirc;che, surtout au large de l'ouest de 
l'&icirc;le de Vancouver, pour aider &agrave;
maintenir les stocks de saumon quinnat et coho des &Eacute;tats de Washington et 
d'Oregon, stocks qui
sont en p&eacute;ril.  Les interceptions par le Canada de saumons n&eacute;s dans des 
eaux am&eacute;ricaines sont
pass&eacute;es de 5 &agrave; 3,5 millions d'individus par an.<p>

&Agrave; la fin de 1992, la plupart des ententes de p&ecirc;che mentionn&eacute;es 
dans le Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du
Pacifique &eacute;taient venus &agrave; expiration, et aucune entente pluriannuelle 
n'avait &eacute;t&eacute; conclue.  Apr&egrave;s
plus de 40 jours de n&eacute;gociations bilat&eacute;rales, les deux pays ont convenu 
de r&eacute;gimes de p&ecirc;che
valides pour un an et d'un processus de n&eacute;gociation &agrave; deux volets : les 
ententes de p&ecirc;che et les
limites de prises seraient n&eacute;goci&eacute;es dans le cadre de la Commission du 
saumon du Pacifique, et la
mise en oeuvre du principe d'&eacute;quit&eacute; du Trait&eacute; ferait l'objet de 
n&eacute;gociations bilat&eacute;rales parall&egrave;les au
niveau f&eacute;d&eacute;ral.<p>

Les n&eacute;gociations des deux volets ont &eacute;t&eacute; houleuses et celles 
portant sur les ententes de p&ecirc;che sont
pr&eacute;sentement dans l'impasse.  Les &Eacute;tats-Unis continuent d'insister pour 
prendre plus de saumons
canadiens, tout en exigeant que le Canada r&eacute;duise encore plus ses prises de 
poissons d'origine
am&eacute;ricaine.  Ils ont fait tra&icirc;ner les n&eacute;gociations et, jusqu'ici, 
n'ont pas pris au s&eacute;rieux les
propositions formul&eacute;es par le Canada pour la mise en oeuvre du principe 
d'&eacute;quit&eacute; et la correction
du d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibre actuel.<p>

<h3>LA PERFORMANCE DU CANADA EN MATI&Egrave;RE DE CONSERVATION</h3>

Dans les derni&egrave;res d&eacute;cennies, le Canada a pris des mesures 
d&eacute;cisives pour maintenir et am&eacute;liorer
les stocks de saumon.<p>

Par exemple, le Canada a r&eacute;ussi &agrave; accro&icirc;tre l'abondance de ses 
stocks en augmentant les
&eacute;chapp&eacute;es cibles (nombre de poissons revenant de la haute mer pour 
frayer qui doit &ecirc;tre atteint
chaque ann&eacute;e pour assurer les niveaux de production optimaux) pour le Fraser, 
site de la plus
grande remonte de saumon rouge au Canada.  Pour respecter ces cibles, il a 
r&eacute;duit la capture,
interdit l'am&eacute;nagement hydro&eacute;lectrique sur le bras principal du fleuve 
et fait des investissements
consid&eacute;rables, totalisant presque 300 millions de dollars canadiens, dans les 
&eacute;closeries et les
am&eacute;liorations des habitats.  Le Canada a inclus dans le Plan vert la protection 
de l'habitat et conclu
des ententes de coop&eacute;ration en mati&egrave;re d'habitat avec la Province de 
Colombie-Britannique et des
groupes autochtones.  Les nombres de saumons rouges revenant au Fraser pour frayer ont 
ainsi
pu atteindre des niveaux record, passant de 25 millions au cours de la p&eacute;riode 
1977-1980 &agrave; 60
millions pour la p&eacute;riode 1989-1992.  Les p&ecirc;cheurs am&eacute;ricains ont 
profit&eacute; du succ&egrave;s de cette
mesure de conservation et accru leurs prises de saumon rouge au large de l'Alaska et 
de l'&Eacute;tat de
Washington.<p>

Lors de la signature du Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du Pacifique, l'abondance du 
saumon quinnat, dont
les cours d'eau d'origine se situent tant dans le sud de la Colombie-Britannique que 
dans les &Eacute;tats
de Washington et d'Oregon, &eacute;tait faible.  Dans le cadre du Trait&eacute;, le 
Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis se
sont entendus sur un programme de conservation et d'am&eacute;lioration pour 
r&eacute;tablir les stocks d'ici
1998.  Le programme de r&eacute;tablissement du Canada s'est traduit par une hausse 
des stocks cl&eacute;s de
saumon quinnat dans le sud de la Colombie-Britannique, qui sont pass&eacute;s de 60 
000 individus au
d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1980 &agrave; 115 000 &agrave; l'heure actuelle, et le 
Canada pense atteindre l'objectif de 145
000 en 1998.  Les Canadiens p&ecirc;chant aux lignes tra&icirc;nantes &agrave; l'ouest 
de l'&icirc;le de Vancouver ont
r&eacute;duit leurs interceptions de saumon quinnat originaire des &Eacute;tats-Unis, 
conform&eacute;ment au
programme de r&eacute;tablissement.<p>

Le Canada a en outre volontairement r&eacute;duit ses interceptions de saumon coho 
originaire de
r&eacute;gions des &Eacute;tats-Unis situ&eacute;es plus au sud pour aider &agrave; 
maintenir les stocks am&eacute;ricains.  En 1987,
il a mis fin &agrave; ses activit&eacute;s de p&ecirc;che au filet &agrave; 
l'extr&eacute;mit&eacute; sud de l'&icirc;le de Vancouver, en raison des
fortes concentrations de saumon coho originaire des &Eacute;tats-Unis dans ce secteur, 
et ramen&eacute; sa
limite de prises totales en de&ccedil;&agrave; des niveaux pr&eacute;vus dans le 
Trait&eacute;.  En 1993, les prises r&eacute;elles de
coho dans les p&ecirc;ches de l'ouest de l'&icirc;le de Vancouver n'atteignaient pas 
un million de poissons, soit
57 % de la limite de 1,7 million fix&eacute;e par le Trait&eacute;.  Ces stocks de 
coho regagnant les cours d'eau
des &Eacute;tats de Washington et d'Oregon ont consid&eacute;rablement baiss&eacute; 
ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, du fait de
la destruction des habitats dulcicoles par l'am&eacute;nagement 
hydro&eacute;lectrique, en particulier le vaste
r&eacute;seau de barrages sur le syst&egrave;me de la Columbia, par l'irrigation, par 
le p&acirc;turage, ainsi que par
l'exploitation mini&egrave;re et foresti&egrave;re.  Les stocks de saumon sont si 
menac&eacute;s que le Pacific Fisheries
Management Council des &Eacute;tats-Unis a impos&eacute; une large interdiction de la 
p&ecirc;che au saumon en
mer, pour l'ann&eacute;e 1994, dans le nord de la Californie et les &Eacute;tats de 
Washington et d'Oregon. 
Tant que les &Eacute;tats-Unis ne se seront pas attaqu&eacute;s &agrave; la cause 
profonde du probl&egrave;me, soit la
d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration de l'habitat, ces stocks continueront de se 
d&eacute;grader.<p>

Pour contribuer encore plus &agrave; la conservation des stocks de saumon coho des 
&Eacute;tats-Unis, le
Canada a propos&eacute;, lors des r&eacute;centes n&eacute;gociations du Trait&eacute; 
sur le saumon du Pacifique, de limiter
&agrave; 1,4 million de poissons en 1994 les prises des p&ecirc;ches de l'ouest de 
l'&icirc;le de Vancouver.  En
&eacute;change, il demande que soit fix&eacute;e une limite similaire pour les 
p&ecirc;ches am&eacute;ricaines au sud-est de
l'Alaska, ce qui aiderait &agrave; r&eacute;tablir le stock de saumon coho de la 
Skeena.  Les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont
jusqu'ici refus&eacute; de donner suite &agrave; cette requ&ecirc;te formul&eacute;e 
par le Canada d'une coop&eacute;ration visant la
conservation.<p>

Comme on l'a dit, il s'est manifest&eacute; des probl&egrave;mes de conservation pour 
le saumon coho
retournant aux cours d'eau du nord de la Colombie-Britannique.  Le milieu dulcicole de 
la Skeena
est intact, mais le nombre de saumons qui y reviennent frayer baisse 
r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement depuis le d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 1970, en grande partie &agrave; cause de la surp&ecirc;che.  Le 
Canada a pris d&egrave;s 1984 des mesures
de conservation du coho, dont la fermeture ou la r&eacute;duction de p&ecirc;ches et, 
m&ecirc;me, la r&eacute;duction de
ses prises de saumon rouge en raison de prises accessoires de coho.  Cependant, les 
interceptions
de coho dans le sud-est de l'Alaska ont tripl&eacute; entre 1988 et 1991, et les 
prises de coho dans cette
r&eacute;gion ont maintenant atteint des niveaux record.  Bien que la r&eacute;duction 
des prises de coho en
Alaska ne soit pas impos&eacute;e par le Trait&eacute; du saumon du Pacifique, aucun 
des deux pays n'est cens&eacute;
accro&icirc;tre intentionnellement les prises de saumons originaires de l'autre.<p>

La production de saumon coho de la Stikine, qui prend sa source dans le nord de la
Colombie-Britannique et traverse le sud-est de l'Alaska pour rejoindre l'oc&eacute;an, 
est elle aussi bien
inf&eacute;rieure aux valeurs cibles.  Comme les p&ecirc;cheurs de l'Alaska prennent 
92 % des d&eacute;barquements
de ces poissons, les mesures de conservation mises en place par le Canada ne peuvent 
&agrave; elles
seules conduire &agrave; un r&eacute;tablissement des stocks.  La coop&eacute;ration 
des &Eacute;tats-Unis est donc
essentielle.<p>

<h3>LES CONS&Eacute;QUENCES D'UN &Eacute;CHEC</h3>


Pour le Canada, le Trait&eacute; sur le saumon du Pacifique constitue le fondement 
d'une gestion durable
de cette pr&eacute;cieuse ressource, &agrave; condition qu'en soient mis en oeuvre les 
deux principes de base : la
conservation et l'&eacute;quit&eacute;.  Si les deux pays ne peuvent pas en venir 
&agrave; une entente de partage
&eacute;quitable, la viabilit&eacute; &agrave; long terme des stocks de saumon de 
toute la c&ocirc;te du Pacifique est
compromise.  Les interceptions augmenteront sans cesse, les mesures de conservation 
seront de
plus en plus illusoires et des communaut&eacute;s enti&egrave;res souffriront.<p>

Pour sortir de l'impasse, le Canada a demand&eacute; aux &Eacute;tats-Unis de faire 
des propositions dans les
domaines suivants :<p>

<ul>
<li>mesures pr&eacute;cises de r&eacute;duction des interceptions de saumon rouge 
canadien par les
&Eacute;tats-Unis;<p>

<li>mesures de conservation des stocks canadiens menac&eacute;s du nord de la
Colombie-Britannique;<p>

<li>mesures d&eacute;dommageant le Canada des prises excessives et in&eacute;quitables 
de saumon
canadien par les &Eacute;tats-Unis.

WARP ERROR MESSAGE "DRIVE X NOT READY PRESS ANY KEY"
</title>
<h3>
WARP ERROR MESSAGE "DRIVE X NOT READY PRESS ANY KEY"
</h3>
Last updated: 27 Dec 1994
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    CUSTOMERS USING THE BOOT MANAGER FEATURE UNDER OS/2 WARP MAY GET
    THE ERROR MESSAGE "DRIVE 1 NOT READY PRESS ANY KEY" AND THE SYSTEM
    BOOTS NORMALLY. OTHER DRIVES NUMBERS MAY ALSO BE REPORTED AS NOT
    READY. THIS IS MOST PREVALENT ON COMPUTERS THAT UTILIZE A SCSI
    HOST ADAPTER.

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    THE CUSTOMER SHOULD CHECK THE HARDWARE SETTINGS OF ALL THE
    DRIVES IN HIS SYSTEM. ON SYSTEMS WITH SCSI HOST ADAPTERS, BE
    CERTAIN THAT ONLY BOOTABLE DRIVES HAVE A SCSI ID OF 0 OR 1.
    USING FDISK FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF OS/2 TO INSTALL THE
    BOOTMANAGER WILL CIRCUMVENT THE MESSAGE.

</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    THE ERROR MESSAGE APPEARING IS THE RESULT OF ADDITIONAL
    MESSAGEING THAT WAS ADDED TO ALERT A USER THAT AN EXTERNAL
    DRIVE MAY NOT BE POWERED ON. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT IT APPEARS
    FOR WARP USERS WITHOUT EXTERNAL DRIVES MAY BE A NON STANDARD
    IMPLENTATION OF THE BIOS IN THE USERS SCSI CARD. USING
    THE FDISK PROGRAM FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OF OS/2 WILL STOP
    THE ERROR MESSAGE FROM APPEARING. FDISK.COM IS LOCATED ON DISK 1
    OF MOST VERSIONS OF OS/2 INSTALLATION DISKETTES, IT IS ALSO IN THE
    \OS2SE21\DISK_2 DIRECTORY OF MOST OS/2 CDROMS.

<center><h2>L'ALENA : EN TIRER TOUS LES AVANTAGES POSSIBLES!</h2></center>
<hr>
<p>

Les &Eacute;tats-Unis, le Mexique et le Canada ont cr&eacute;&eacute; une zone de 
libre-&eacute;change en vertu de l'ALENA
en vue de stimuler la croissance &eacute;conomique des trois pays. Ils ont 
&eacute;labor&eacute; l'accord pour s'assurer
un acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s des autres pays signataires et rendre leurs 
industries plus comp&eacute;titives &agrave;
l'&eacute;chelle mondiale. Cependant, contrairement au March&eacute; commun 
europ&eacute;en ou &agrave; l'accord de
commerce entre l'Australie et la Nouvelle-Z&eacute;lande, l'ALENA n'a pas 
modifi&eacute; les lois nationales
permettant des recours commerciaux (antidumping, subventions ou droits compensateurs). 
Les
trois gouvernements ont donc convenu qu'il fallait trouver des solutions pour 
r&eacute;duire les risques
de diff&eacute;rends au sujet des questions de subventions, de dumping et 
d'application des lois de
recours commercial.<p>


<h3>Pourquoi &eacute;tudier maintenant les avantages d'une r&eacute;duction des voies de 
recours commercial en
vertu de l'ALENA?</h3>

<ul> 
<li>Plus grande int&eacute;gration de l'&eacute;conomie nord-am&eacute;ricaine.<p>


<li>Les industries nord-am&eacute;ricaines ne peuvent se permettre de tol&eacute;rer les 
inefficiences
auxquelles donnent lieu de telles mesures.<p>

<li>Les dirigeants des trois pays se sont engag&eacute;s politiquement &agrave; trouver 
des solutions pour
r&eacute;duire les diff&eacute;rends.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Actuellement, quelle est l'ampleur des recours commerciaux entrepris en vertu de 
l'ALENA?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Au total, depuis 1986, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont entam&eacute; 58 
proc&eacute;dures antidumping
et ont demand&eacute; 11 enqu&ecirc;tes relativement &agrave; des droits 
compensateurs, et ce concernant un large
&eacute;ventail de produits.<p>

<li>L'industrie mexicaine a aussi commenc&eacute; &agrave; avoir largement recours aux 
lois antidumping et
aux lois sur les droits compensateurs.
</ul>
<p>


<h3>Pourquoi l'industrie am&eacute;ricaine se pr&eacute;occupe-t-elle de telles questions?
</h3>
<ul>
<li>La richesse des &Eacute;tats-Unis d&eacute;pend de plus en plus du commerce 
international, qui
repr&eacute;sentait 22 % du PIB en 1993 contre 16 % en 1975 et 9,7 % en 1960.<p>

<li>Les exportateurs am&eacute;ricains sont de plus en plus la cible des recours 
commerciaux.<p>

<li>Le commerce dans le cadre de l'ALENA diff&egrave;re de celui qui se pratique 
&agrave; l'&eacute;tranger :
livraisons au moment ad&eacute;quat par opposition &agrave; livraisons importantes 
libres de contrat;
rationalisation de la production au sein d'un march&eacute; r&eacute;gional.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Quels sont les co&ucirc;ts des recours commerciaux?</h3>

Augmentation des co&ucirc;ts des intrants et pertes de production, entra&icirc;nant:
<p>
<ul>
<li>moins grande comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des entreprises nord-am&eacute;ricaines 
par rapport aux entreprises &eacute;trang&egrave;res;<p>

<li>dommages mutuels aux industries nord-am&eacute;ricaines si les fabricants ont des
fournisseurs et clients communs (comme dans le cas de l'acier).
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Dans le cadre de l'ALENA, quelles autres mesures pourrait-on utiliser &agrave; la 
place des recours
commerciaux pour r&eacute;gler les cas d'importations pr&eacute;judiciables et 
d'&eacute;tablissement de prix abusifs?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Des mesures de sauvegarde.<p>

<li>Des lois nationales sur la concurrence.<p>

<li>Une r&eacute;vision des pratiques antidumping des pays signataires de l'ALENA
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Que disent les experts?
</h3>

<blockquote>[TRADUCTION]
Le remplacement des lois antidumping par des lois sur la concurrence,
concernant les op&eacute;rations effectu&eacute;es tant au sein des pays signataires 
de l'ALENA qu'entre ces
pays, serait beaucoup plus conforme &agrave; l'esprit de la cr&eacute;ation d'une zone 
de libre-&eacute;change que les
lois antidumping actuelles.</blockquote><p>

<i>American Bar Association, novembre 1994</i>

<p>

<blockquote>[TRADUCTION]
Nous pensons qu'il est n&eacute;cessaire d'appliquer de telles lois de 
mani&egrave;re
judicieuse de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; minimiser leurs r&eacute;percussions 
&eacute;conomiques d&eacute;favorables sur les industries
am&eacute;ricaines qui se situent en aval de celles ayant des pratiques commerciales 
d&eacute;loyales.</blockquote> <p>

<P><I>[Editor's Note: Last month we published a security bulletin from CIAC
regarding a serious password security flaw in Windows 95. Since then we've
located information from the Mocrosoft Web site on the subject.</I></P>
<P><I>An article posted to the Risks list suggests that this same security
defect also exists in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups.versions 3.1 and 3.11.
While Microsoft has released a bug fix for Windows 95, they apparently have
neither acknowledged nor provided a Windows for Workgroups fix. --had]</I></P>
<H2><A NAME="0">Enhanced Password Cache Security Update</A></H2>
<P><IMG SRC="vulner-1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=245 HEIGHT=85 ALT="">
<P>(Download: 271 KB, self-extracting Zip file, published: December 13th, 1995)</P>
<P>This update is an enhanced security component that substantially strengthens
the encryption used for the Microsoft Windows 95 password cache. The new
component uses a 128-bit key, increased from a 32-bit key in the previous
version. The new component also includes enhancements to the way passwords are
stored in the PWL file.</P><UL>
<LI>The previous PWL file will be automatically upgraded to the new format.
<LI>This component replaces the <TT>MSPWL32.DLL</TT> and <TT>NET.EXE</TT> files.
<LI>NET.EXE, which is usually used from the command line, will no longer use the
password cache&#151;users will be prompted for passwords while using <TT>NET.EXE</TT>.
</UL>
<P>By using the new component, customers will have a PWL file that is very
secure. In fact, with the new 128-bit security, the new component is 2^96 (2 to
the 96th power) times harder to decrypt. </P>  

<H2><A NAME="1">Background </A></H2>
<P>Windows 95 uses an optional caching mechanism to store network passwords on
a user's machine. When a user first types and saves a password while connecting
to a password protected resource, the user can choose to store the password in a
local password list file. Subsequent logins with a Windows 95 password unlocks
the list and associates those stored passwords with the Windows 95 password. If
the user does not choose to use password caching, they must type the passwords
each time they connect to a password protected resource. </P>
<P>Recently, an algorithm was posted on the Internet which could be used to
compromise the security used in the previous version of the password list file.
If someone had access to the password list file on the hard disk of a Windows 95
machine and the decryption algorithm, they may have been able to perform
operations on the file that could generate the unencrypted password(s). </P>
<P>After installing this new component, the password file will be well
protected against security violations.</P>

Subject: Microsoft continues to mislead public about Windows security bugs</TT></P>
<P>Please do not dismiss this as mere &quot;Microsoft Bashing.&quot; c2.org has
similar promotions running for Netscape, DigiCash, and Java. </P>
<P>The following is a quote from Microsoft's &quot;Knowledge Base&quot;

<P>[...]</P> 

<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>Security of the Windows for Workgroups Password Cache</B></FONT></P>
<P>The password list file is encrypted with an algorithm that meets the U.S.
government Data Encryption Standard (DES). This encryption technology is the
highest security allowed in software exported from the United States. The odds
of breaking the encryption algorithm are less than those for random guesses of
what the password might be.</P>
<P>Even if your logon password is blank, Windows for Workgroups generates
seemingly random data in your PWL file, so you cannot discover the passwords if
you look at the PWL file using a file viewer. Currently, no user interface

caching in Windows for Workgroups is as secure as the choice of the password
used to encrypt your PWL file.</P>

<P>As Microsoft well knows, this is completely untrue. The rest of the world
has known that this is untrue since November 29th. Microsoft quietly
acknowledged on December 7th (after a day of much &quot;Internet Strategy&quot;
hype, and after the deadline for the morning papers) that the exact same
implementation was insecure in Windows 95, and claims to have released a patch
that fixes the problem (the efficacy of the Win95 patch does not appear to have
been verified by anyone outside Microsoft, however). </P>
<P>Microsoft has not even admitted that this bug in both Windows 95 and Windows
for Workgroups affects Windows for Workgroups, apparently because they have
decided not to fix it. </P>
<P>Information on the .PWL implementation bugs was first broached on the 
sci.crypt newsgroup in late November 1995, then discussed on the  cypherpunks
list and refined for Community ConneXion's &quot;Hack Microsoft&quot; promotion,
<A HREF="http://www.c2.org/hackmsoft/"><B><TT>http://www.c2.org/hackmsoft/</TT></B></A>.</P>
<P>We have since been given a sample trojan horse that will very efficiently
exploit this bug in Windows for Workgroups. Distributed as a Word Basic virus,
MIME attachment, or downloadable archive (note that Exchange and Internet
Explorer unwisely execute downloaded binaries without even a virus check, a
problem that Sun's Java has long acknowledged and addressed), this trojan horse
could collect passwords and other sensitive information from .PWL files and
other sources and send them out via e-mail, possibly through an untraceable
chain of remailers or to a throwaway trial account on, for example, America &quot;Online.&quot;</P>
<P>We believe that it would be highly irresponsible to release the full version
of this hack, but we will soon release a crippled demonstration-only version if
Microsoft does not at the very least admit that this problem has always affected
Windows for Workgroups, correct their online documentation, publish the
specifications of the Win95 security patch for review by outside security
experts, and issue a public retraction.</P>

<P>In other news, I assume everyone knows by now that NT's claimed C2 security
rating was granted *for use a standalone workstation only*. It has been widely
reported that its NetWare Services implementation does not ask for passwords for
nonexistent usernames, making a potential cracker's job that much easier. The
correct response, which is given by real NetWare servers and other servers that
are certified C2-secure on networks, is to silently ask for a password in all
cases.</P>
<P>I started getting copies of hackmsoft@c2.org mail on December 20th. It's
really depressing.</P>
<P>We've also seen problems with Microsoft Access 95's security. Basically,
there is none. Anyone can access the network-enabled Access as any user without
knowing the password. We don't think it would be responsible to publicly release
this hack, either, until Microsoft has had another chance to patch the hole
(they've known about it for some time).</P>
<P>These are far, far worse than the widely publicized bugs in Netscape's SSL
implementation, which have been fixed. Yet the only place I've seen them
mentioned is the lapdog Seattle Times, which only reports bug *fixes* in glowing
terms.</P>
<P>Is anybody listening?</P>

Subject: HUGE WINDOWS 95 SECURITY HOLE!!!!</TT></P>
<P>I've just discovered a huge security hole in Windows 95 that affects ALL
32-bit virus scanning programs.</P>
<P>The hole prevents A/V programs from accessing specially named files.</P>
<P>To understand how it works, you have to know a little bit about how DOS
works:</P>
<P>In DOS, when a file is deleted, the first character in the file name is
overwritten with ASCII character 229, and it is removed from the File Allocation
Table (FAT). DOS does lets you use ASCII 229 as the first character of filenames
and directories without any problems, though.</P>
<P>With windows 95, however, if it detects that the first character of any file
or directory is ASCII 229, it will tell you that the file does not exist, even
though this is not true.</P>
<P>I tested out McAfee's latest ViruScan 95, and it could not access infected
files in directories starting with ASCII 229. Additionally, files starting with
ASCII 229 that were infected came up as uninfected. </P>
<P>It is interesting to note that old DOS-based scanners still work.</P>
<P>Potential RISKS include: </P><UL>
<LI>Viruses that have specially named data files to prevent detection
<LI>Viruses that store a copy of themselves in a protected directory and infect from there.
</UL>
<P>NOTE that this appears to be a problem with Windows 95, not the virus
scanners. Specifically, the built-in file querying routines. I can't think of
any workable solutions to the problem offhand.</P>

<center><h2>Am&eacute;nagement de l' Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Le Canada a transmis aux autorit&eacute;s am&eacute;ricaines ses 
craintes concernant des propositions du
budget du Congr&egrave;s qui pourraient entra&icirc;ner 
l'ouverture de la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re de l'Arctic 
National
Wildlife Refuge &agrave; l'am&eacute;nagement p&eacute;trolier et 

gazier. De l'avis du Canada, l'am&eacute;nagement de ces
terres fragiles de mise bas de la harde de caribous de la 
Porcupine constitue une s&eacute;rieuse menace
pour ces b&ecirc;tes et pour d'autres esp&egrave;ces sauvages 
migratrices que le Canada partage avec les
&Eacute;tats-Unis.<p>

Le troupeau de plus de 160 000 caribous vit dans le nord-est de 
l'Alaska, le nord du Yukon et le
delta du Mackenzie dans les Territoires du Nord-Ouest. 
L'alimentation et la survie du mode
d'existence traditionnel de milliers d'autochtones des deux pays 
d&eacute;pendent de cette harde.<p>

En 1987, le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis ont ratifi&eacute; 
l'Accord sur la conservation du caribou de la
Porcupine o&ugrave; ils convenaient de prot&eacute;ger le 
troupeau et son habitat et de se consulter
promptement si la harde ou l'habitat subissait des dommages ou 
encore si les voies migratoires
&eacute;taient interrompues. Des scientifiques experts du Canada 
et des &Eacute;tats-Unis ont conclu que toute
forme d'am&eacute;nagement de la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re 
constituerait une grave menace pour les habitudes de
mise bas et de migration de la harde.<p>

De l'avis du Canada, le meilleur moyen d'assurer l'avenir du 
caribou de la Porcupine est de
d&eacute;clarer la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re de l'arctique  
zone prot&eacute;g&eacute;e , ce qui conf&eacute;rerait &agrave; 
cette ressource fauve
commune une protection &eacute;gale de part et d'autre de la 
fronti&egrave;re.<p>

Par la cr&eacute;ation en 1984 du Parc national du Nord-du-Yukon 
(aujourd'hui Ivvavik), le Canada
assure, en en faisant une zone prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, une 
protection permanente &agrave; une vaste proportion de
l'habitat dont une partie de la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re du 
Yukon o&ugrave; la femelle met bas &agrave; l'occasion. De plus,
la cr&eacute;ation du Parc national Vuntut, au sud d'Ivvavik, a 
permis de soustraire de l'am&eacute;nagement des
portions suppl&eacute;mentaires de l'habitat. La majeure partie 
du reste de l'aire de distribution de la
harde en territoire canadien s'&eacute;tend sur des terres dont 
l'am&eacute;nagement est interdit ou encore qui
sont couvertes par des ententes fonci&egrave;res des autochtones, 

qui imposent de s&eacute;rieuses restrictions &agrave;
l'am&eacute;nagement. <p>

La majeure partie de l'habitat alaskien du troupeau occupe 
l'Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, cr&eacute;&eacute;
en 1960 et &eacute;tendu vingt ans plus tard par l'Alaska 
National Interest Conservation Lands Act (Loi
sur les terres prot&eacute;g&eacute;es d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t 
national en Alaska). Bien qu'un interdit d'exploitation frappe la
majeure proportion de la r&eacute;serve, les terres de mise bas  
englobent un territoire &agrave; l'est de Prudhoe
Bay que le Congr&egrave;s a d&eacute;sign&eacute; en vue d'un 
&eacute;ventuel am&eacute;nagement p&eacute;trolier et gazier, 
aux termes
de l'article 1002 de cette Loi. La Loi charge le 
secr&eacute;taire &agrave; l'Int&eacute;rieur de consulter le 
Canada lors
de l'&eacute;valuation de l'effet d'un am&eacute;nagement, en 
particulier au sujet de la harde de caribous de la
Porcupine.<p>

La zone c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re de 1,5 million d'acres, 
appel&eacute;e terres de l'article 1002, h&eacute;berge une riche 

vari&eacute;t&eacute;
d'autres esp&egrave;ces sauvages dont le loup, le carcajou, 
l'ours polaire, l'ours brun de la toundra, le
boeuf musk&eacute; et le mouflon de Dall. Pr&egrave;s de 140 
esp&egrave;ces d'oiseaux, dont l'aigle &agrave; t&ecirc;te 
blanche, le
cygne de Bewick et l'oie des neiges, utilisent la r&eacute;gion 
comme escale, car bon nombre migre entre
le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis.<p>

Le Canada s'inqui&egrave;te fortement de l'effet de 
l'am&eacute;nagement sur le caribou de la Porcupine, que son
cycle vital rend particuli&egrave;rement vuln&eacute;rable 
&agrave; toute perturbation.<p>

Au printemps, les femelles commencent &agrave; migrer des aires 
d'hivernage (situ&eacute;es surtout au Canada)
vers les terres de mise bas sur la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re. 
Bien que des naissances surviennent dans le Parc
national d'Ivvavit, au Yukon, la plupart des faons naissent en 
Alaska, sur une &eacute;troite bande de
toundra qui s'&eacute;tend entre la cha&icirc;ne de Brooks et la 
mer de Beaufort, les terres de l'article 1002.<p>

Apr&egrave;s la p&eacute;riode de mise bas, le reste du troupeau 
rejoint les femelles pour constituer un immense
regroupement le long de la c&ocirc;te o&ugrave; le caribou viande 

et accumule des forces en vue de la
migration d'automne. La densit&eacute; de la harde 
(jusqu'&agrave; 50 000 sujets par mille carr&eacute;) la 
prot&egrave;ge
contre les pr&eacute;dateurs.<p>

Un comit&eacute; consultatif scientifique aupr&egrave;s de 
l'International Porcupine Caribou Board, institu&eacute; en
vertu de l'accord canado-am&eacute;ricain, a indiqu&eacute;, dans 

un rapport de 1993, que la p&eacute;riode de mise
bas et de post-partum constitue la phase la plus 
d&eacute;terminante du cycle vital du caribou et le
moment o&ugrave; il est le plus vuln&eacute;rable aux 
perturbations dues &agrave; l'&ecirc;tre humain.<p>

Comme les terres de mise bas et de post-partum s'&eacute;tendent 
dans la zone propos&eacute;e pour
l'am&eacute;nagement, la plus d&eacute;licate phase du cycle 
vital du caribou pourrait s'en trouver gravement
affect&eacute;e. Les terres de l'article 1002 comptent les plus 
riches p&acirc;turages et sont les plus abrit&eacute;es des
pr&eacute;dateurs et des insectes. Si le troupeau devait se 
d&eacute;placer vers des aires d'alimentation plus
pauvres et moins prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, la survie des femelles 
et des nouveau-n&eacute;s durant la migration pourrait
&ecirc;tre menac&eacute;e. Le Canada craint aussi que la 
construction de pipelines, de routes et autres
infrastructures associ&eacute;es &agrave; l'am&eacute;nagement 
n'alt&egrave;rent les voies migratoires du troupeau vers son
territoire.<p>

Le d&eacute;clin de la population de caribou aurait 
d'&eacute;normes r&eacute;percussions n&eacute;gatives sur le 
mode de vie
des  autochtones qui en d&eacute;pendent depuis des 
mill&eacute;naires. Par exemple, la harde de caribous de la
Porcupine est la principale source d'aliments et un 
&eacute;l&eacute;ment fondamental  de la structure sociale des
7 000 membres de la Nation Gwitch'in du Canada et de l'Alaska. 
Contrairement aux autochtones
qui vivent dans la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re de l'Alaska, les 
Gwitch'in des terres int&eacute;rieures disposeraient de
peu de sources d'alimentation de rechange s'il fallait que la 
population de caribou diminue ou que
ses voies migratoires soient perturb&eacute;es.<p>

&Agrave; cause des r&eacute;percussions possibles de 
l'am&eacute;nagement de la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re de 
l'Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge sur la faune canadienne et sur les populations 
autochtones, le Canada a maintes et
maintes fois exhort&eacute; les pouvoirs am&eacute;ricains 
&agrave; assurer &agrave; la r&eacute;gion une protection 
permanente en la
d&eacute;clarant zone prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. <p>

Travaux d'am&eacute;nagement par le Canada<p>

Le Canada n'a jamais autoris&eacute; de forage dans les terres de 

mise bas du caribou de la Porcupine qui
s'&eacute;tendent sur son territoire, bien que des forages 
exploratoires aient eu lieu entre 1957 et 1985 
dans certaines parties moins fragiles de l'habitat de la harde. 
Au total, 78 puits ont &eacute;t&eacute; creus&eacute;s,
dont trois dans la plaine c&ocirc;ti&egrave;re &agrave; 
l'ext&eacute;rieur des terres de mise bas et le reste dans 
l'habitat
d'automne et d'hiver du troupeau. Malgr&eacute; des pressions 
sensibles pour que d'autres travaux
d'exploration min&eacute;rale et l 'am&eacute;nagement aient 
lieu, ni le p&eacute;trole ni le gaz n'ont jamais 
&eacute;t&eacute; extraits
dans la r&eacute;gion et les puits ont &eacute;t&eacute; 
abandonn&eacute;s. Le forage et l'exploitation mini&egrave;re 
sont maintenant
interdits dans de vastes proportions de l'habitat du troupeau au 
Canada.<p>

La route de Dempster, qui relie le Yukon et les Territoires du 
Nord-Ouest, a &eacute;t&eacute; construite &agrave; la fin
des ann&eacute;es 50 et dans les ann&eacute;es 60 en remplacement 

du chemin d'hiver qui existait alors. Elle
traverse une voie de migration du caribou sans jamais toutefois 
se rapprocher des terres de mise
bas. Malgr&eacute; certaines craintes suscit&eacute;es au 
d&eacute;but, la route peu fr&eacute;quent&eacute;e n'a pas 
modifi&eacute; les
habitudes migratoires du troupeau. Comme elle ouvre aux chasseurs 

un plus grand acc&egrave;s aux
caribous, la chasse est restreinte le long du corridor de cette 
route.<p>

<center><h2>Le point sur l'&eacute;conomie au premier trimestre</h2></center>
<hr>
<p>

D'apr&egrave;s Statistique Canada, les &eacute;changes totaux de marchandises entre le
Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis
ont atteint au premier trimestre de 1995 une valeur marchande de 88,7 milliards de
dollars US, en
hausse de 29 p. 100 par rapport &agrave; la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode en 1994. Le
Canada a vendu pour 49,9
milliards de dollars de biens aux &Eacute;tats-Unis et leur en a achet&eacute; pour
38,8 milliards.<p>

L'&eacute;conomie du Canada a ralenti brusquement au cours du premier trimestre de
l'ann&eacute;e, le taux de
croissance annuel r&eacute;el ne s'&eacute;tablissant qu'&agrave; 0,7 p. 100, alors 
qu'au cours de la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode en
1994, le PIB avait progress&eacute; de 4,6 p. 100. Ce ralentissement a 
&eacute;t&eacute; attribu&eacute; &agrave; la hausse des taux
d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t, qui a frein&eacute; les d&eacute;penses &agrave; la 
consommation, aux conflits de travail des chemins de fer et
des ports, et &agrave; la torpeur de l'&eacute;conomie du plus grand partenaire 
commercial du Canada, les
&Eacute;tats-Unis. Bien que les investissements commerciaux aient progress&eacute; 
durant le trimestre, les
d&eacute;penses &agrave; la consommation ont fl&eacute;chi et les exportations 
r&eacute;elles n'ont connu qu'une hausse de 1,3
p. 100 par rapport au trimestre ant&eacute;rieur.<p>

Admettant le ralentissement de l'&eacute;conomie, le ministre des Finances, M. Paul 
Martin, esp&egrave;re une
reprise ult&eacute;rieurement cette ann&eacute;e. &Agrave; son avis, le gouvernement 
devrait atteindre ses objectifs en
mati&egrave;re de r&eacute;duction du d&eacute;ficit malgr&eacute; la l&eacute;thargie 
de l'&eacute;conomie, car son budget est fond&eacute; sur des
pr&eacute;visions de revenus tr&egrave;s prudentes.<p>

En juin, le gouverneur de la Banque du Canada, M. Gordon Thiessen, a soutenu que 
l'&eacute;conomie
canadienne est fondamentalement vigoureuse en raison du faible taux d'inflation (2,5 
p. 100), de la
hausse de la productivit&eacute; et des efforts du f&eacute;d&eacute;ral et des 
provinces pour &eacute;ponger leurs d&eacute;ficits. &Agrave;
ce qu'il a d&eacute;clar&eacute;, nous devons tenir compte de la tendance sous-jacente 
et du grand nombre de
facteurs positifs qui entrent en jeu.

<title>Using Jumbo Colorado Tape Drives with OS/2</title>
<h2>Using Jumbo Colorado Tape Drives with OS/2</h2>
Last Updated: 6th May, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<pre>
   I've tried to use my 250meg Colorado with 'Tape' the program that come 
   with it and i get 'Drive Comunication Failure'.. Under dos, it work #1 no 
   problem.. 

                                            from a recent USENET article
</pre>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
250MB Jumbo Colorado Tape Drive
<h2>Problem</h2>
The software supplied with the tape drive does
not run correctly under OS/2.
<h2>Fix</h2>
Get IBM DualStor for OS/2 from Indelible Blue. 
<p>
It's about US$ 45 and it will support your Jumbo 250.  You don't want to
use the DOS TAPE program which shipped with your drive as it is OS/2
unaware - it won't backup the EA files; and, could really screw things
up on restores.  It is possible to use special utilities to backup and
restore the EA files under DOS; but, it isn't worth it with DualStor
being so cheap and reliable.
<h2>Notes</h2>
John Comish (jcomish@gtc.itt.com) writes (1st April, 1995):
<p>
HP ( owner of Colorado Memory Systems ) is shipping a very nice OS/2
version of their software for the Trakker and Jumbo drives.  I have
personally used this with 2.11 full pack, Warp for Windows and Warp full
pack with delightful results.

<center><h2>Position du Canada quant &agrave; l'&eacute;tablissement d'un droit de passage
de la fronti&egrave;re</h2></center>
<hr>
<p>

Dans son budget de l'exercice financier de 1996, le gouvernement f&eacute;d&eacute;ral 
am&eacute;ricain propose
d'&eacute;tablir un droit que devront payer les conducteurs de v&eacute;hicules 
automobiles et les pi&eacute;tons qui
franchissent la fronti&egrave;re am&eacute;ricaine &agrave; l'un des points 
d'entr&eacute;e au pays. Si elle se concr&eacute;tisait, cette
mesure permettrait de percevoir des droits de 3 $ US par v&eacute;hicule et de 1,50 $ 
US par pi&eacute;ton. Le
Canada est d'avis que l'&eacute;tablissement d'un droit de passage de la 
fronti&egrave;re va &agrave; l'encontre des
efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s conjointement par les deux pays pour favoriser la 
cr&eacute;ation de liens d'affaires et
encourager le commerce transfrontalier. En outre, la perception de ces droits 
g&ecirc;nerait la
circulation commerciale et touristique et imposerait un fardeau financier &agrave; bon 
nombre de
Canadiens et d'Am&eacute;ricains.<p>

L'&eacute;tablissement de droits d'utilisation des services frontaliers irait 
&agrave; l'encontre des
efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par le Canada et les &Eacute;tats-Unis pour faciliter 
le mouvement transfronti&egrave;res des
personnes et des marchandises.<p>

Les Canadiens et les Am&eacute;ricains ont toujours pu franchir la fronti&egrave;re 
sans rien payer.
L'&eacute;tablissement par les &Eacute;tats-Unis d'un droit de passage de la 
fronti&egrave;re constituerait une premi&egrave;re
dans la longue histoire des relations canado-am&eacute;ricaines du fait que l'on 
exigerait d&eacute;sormais des
droits d'entr&eacute;e aux &Eacute;tats-Unis de toute personne venant du Canada.<p>


 L'&eacute;tablissement des droits de passage toucherait chaque ann&eacute;e 
pr&egrave;s de 100 millions
de voyageurs canadiens et am&eacute;ricains.<p>


Selon les donn&eacute;es canadiennes, entre le 1er avril 1993 et le 31 mars 1994, 
approximativement 55
millions de Canadiens et 43 millions d'Am&eacute;ricains ont franchi la 
fronti&egrave;re pour se rendre dans le
pays voisin et en revenir par la route. Outre le fait d'&ecirc;tre assujettis au droit 
de passage, les
Canadiens et les Am&eacute;ricains seraient soumis &agrave; la perturbation de la 
circulation qu'entra&icirc;nerait la
perception des droits. Les collectivit&eacute;s frontali&egrave;res, o&ugrave; 
r&eacute;sident des Canadiens et des Am&eacute;ricains
qui franchissent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement la fronti&egrave;re pour se rendre au 
travail, aller faire des visites ou aller
faire des courses, seraient particuli&egrave;rement touch&eacute;es. Ce droit de 
passage serait un fardeau
financier inutile pour les familles canadiennes et am&eacute;ricaines qui se 
d&eacute;placent fr&eacute;quemment pour
aller visiter leur parent&eacute; de l'autre c&ocirc;t&eacute; de la fronti&egrave;re.
<p>

La perception du droit de passage entra&icirc;nerait une congestion accrue aux 
points
d'entr&eacute;e &agrave; la fronti&egrave;re et la perturbation de la circulation 
commerciale.<p>

Les modalit&eacute;s de perception et d'administration cr&eacute;eraient des goulots 
d'&eacute;tranglement
suppl&eacute;mentaires aux points d'entr&eacute;e &agrave; la fronti&egrave;re 
d&eacute;j&agrave; fort achaland&eacute;s, ce qui retarderait les gens
d'affaires en voyage et les livraisons de marchandises. Le ralentissement de la 
circulation risquerait
de d&eacute;courager le commerce dans les collectivit&eacute;s frontali&egrave;res.<p>


<h3>Quels co&ucirc;ts ces mesures commerciales repr&eacute;sentent-elles?</h3>

Des co&ucirc;ts de revient accrus et une perte de production pouvant se traduire par 
<p>
<ul>
<li>une diminution de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle 
internationale des entreprises vis&eacute;es par l'ALENA;<p>
<li>un pr&eacute;judice r&eacute;ciproque aux branches d'activit&eacute; vis&eacute;es 
par l'ALENA dans lesquelles
les fabricants ont les m&ecirc;mes fournisseurs et les m&ecirc;mes clients (p. ex. 
dans celle de l'acier).
</ul>
<p>


<h3>Quelles autres mesures commerciales pourraient plut&ocirc;t &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es 
pour r&eacute;gler la question des
importations pr&eacute;judiciables et de la fixation de prix abusifs dans les pays 
signataires de l'ALENA?</h3>

<ul>

<li>Adopter des mesures l&eacute;gislatives en mati&egrave;re de sauvegarde d'urgence<p>

<li>Adopter des lois relatives &agrave; la concurrence interne.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Quelles mesures le Canada est-il pr&ecirc;t &agrave; consid&eacute;rer?</h3>

<ul>
<li>L'&eacute;limination ou la r&eacute;vision de la loi sur les droits antidumping pour 
les pays signataires de l'ALENA.<p>

<li>L'adoption d'autres mesures disciplinaires pour ce qui concerne les subventions.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Quel est l'avis des principaux int&eacute;ress&eacute;s?</h3>


<blockquote> Selon nous, il est n&eacute;cessaire d'appliquer ces mesures l&eacute;gislatives 
judicieusement afin de r&eacute;duire le
plus possible le risque de pr&eacute;judice financier que pourraient subir les 
industries am&eacute;ricaines en aval
de celles qui font l'objet de proc&eacute;dures relatives aux pratiques commerciales 
d&eacute;loyales. </blockquote><p>

<i>Avocat de General Motors devant la U.S. International Trade Commission, 1994</i>

<p>


<blockquote> Le remplacement de la loi sur les droits antidumping par une loi sur la concurrence, 
pour ce qui
concerne les op&eacute;rations commerciales effectu&eacute;es dans les pays 
signataires de l'ALENA et entre
ces pays, est davantage conforme au concept de zone de libre-&eacute;change que ne le 
serait le maintien
de cette loi.</blockquote> <p>

<i>American Bar Association, novembre 1994</i><p>


<blockquote> Le recours croissant &agrave; des mesures visant &agrave; corriger certaines 
pratiques d&eacute;loyales en mati&egrave;re de
commerce minera l'impact positif de l'ouverture des march&eacute;s.</blockquote> <p>

<i>American Enterprise Institute, d&eacute;cembre 1994</i><p>

C'est gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'adoption de lois visant &agrave; corriger certaines 
pratiques commerciales dans le cadre de
l'ALENA que l'on permettra aux entreprises nord-am&eacute;ricaines de r&eacute;aliser 
des &eacute;conomies d'&eacute;chelle
plus substantielles et de devenir plus comp&eacute;titives.<p>

L'industrie am&eacute;ricaine est invit&eacute;e &agrave; consid&eacute;rer l'adoption 
de lois r&eacute;vis&eacute;es visant &agrave; corriger certaines
pratiques commerciales dans le cadre de l'ALENA.<p>

Printer does not print
</title>
<h2>
Printer does not print 
</h2>
Last Updated: 5th December, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Spooler reports a printer as off-line or out of paper, or printer
   accepts data but never prints. Printer works fine under DOS or
   previous version of OS/2.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   Various printers, including an Oki OL400 (emulating HP LaserJetII),
   a real HP LaserJet II, HP PaintJet and PaintJet-XL, a HP Deskjet
   Plus, Panasonic models KX-P1124i and KX-P1123, an NEC SilentWriter
   2/M90 (PS laser printer), and a Fujitsu 7100PS.  Not to mention
   Lantastic printer support.

<h2>Problem</h2>

   Under OS/2 2.x, the low-level printer support was interrupt driven,
   using IRQ7 for LPT1 and IRQ5 for LPT2.  This was good (low
   overhead, good throughput) and bad (IRQ conflicts with
   SoundBlasters and other adapters, no choice on IRQ used, printer
   adapters and cables which worked under DOS might not under OS/2).
<p>
   Beginning with OS/2 Warp Version 3, the OS/2 Development staff
   introduced a "stealth" enhancement:  the default low-level printer
   support is now handled by periodically "polling" the printer port
   to see when it can accept the next character.  This is good (allows
   a lot of printers, cables, and LPTx adapters to work under OS/2
   that might not otherwise) and bad (increased overhead).
<p>
   User feedback seems to be mixed.  Some printers seem to work
   acceptably with OS/2 polled printing, some do not.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   You can re-introduce interrupt-driven printer support by editing
   your OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file to add a /IRQ to the PRINT01.SYS or
   PRINT02.SYS statement.  For more information, type HELP BASEDEV at
   a command prompt and then do a Search for PRINT01.

<h2>Notes</h2>

   Human nature being what it is, there are more postings describing
   printer problems than reports of printers working roperly with the
   new polled support.  At first I thought it might be related to the
   new OMNI driver (another Warp "stealth" feature), but I don't
   believe that the HP Laserjets or PostScript printers use the OMNI
   driver.  If anyone can come up with specific criteria that can
   determine whether a given printer or LPT1 adapter will work
   properly using Warp's default "polled" printer support, please let
   me know.
<p>
   Although it is nowhere explicitly stated, it appears that there is
   still no choice on printer IRQs if you use them.  With the /IRQ
   parameter in place IRQ7 will be used for LPT1 and IRQ5 for LPT2.

<hr>
<p>

<h3>Le gouvernement conservateur de l'Ontario promet des baisses d'imp&ocirc;ts.</h3>


Le premier ministre nouvellement &eacute;lu de l'Ontario, M. Mike Harris, a 
d&eacute;clar&eacute; que la premi&egrave;re
priorit&eacute; de son gouvernement sera de stimuler l'&eacute;conomie.<p>



&#171;Pour nous, il ne fait aucun doute qu'il faut relancer l'&eacute;conomie, et la baisse 
des imp&ocirc;ts est l'un
des moyens cl&eacute;s pour y parvenir,
&#187; a d&eacute;clar&eacute; M. Harris. &#171;Notre 
&eacute;conomie a besoin de stimulants&#187; . Il
a soulign&eacute; que la moiti&eacute; des baisses promises sera pr&eacute;vue dans le 
premier budget de son
gouvernement, l'an prochain.<p>

Le Parti progressiste conservateur s'est assur&eacute; une forte majorit&eacute; 
&agrave; l'&eacute;lection provinciale du 8 juin
en faisant campagne sur les th&egrave;mes de l'amenuisement de l'appareil 
gouvernemental, de la baisse
des imp&ocirc;ts et de la r&eacute;forme de l'aide sociale. Le Parti a remport&eacute; 
82 si&egrave;ges &agrave; la Chambre sur un
total de 130 et 45 p. 100 du vote populaire. M. Harris a pr&ecirc;t&eacute; serment 
comme premier ministre le
26 juin, succ&eacute;dant ainsi au N&eacute;o-d&eacute;mocrate Bob Rae.<p>


Le Parti sortant, le Parti n&eacute;o-d&eacute;mocrate (NPD), est arriv&eacute; 
troisi&egrave;me avec seulement 17 si&egrave;ges et
20 p. 100 du vote, alors que les Lib&eacute;raux se sont assur&eacute;s 30 
si&egrave;ges et 31 p. 100 du vote. Un si&egrave;ge
a &eacute;t&eacute; remport&eacute; par un ind&eacute;pendant.<p>

Le Parti conservateur a d&eacute;tenu le pouvoir sans interruption pendant plus de 40 
ann&eacute;es avant la
victoire des Lib&eacute;raux en 1985.<p>

Dans sa plate-forme, la  &#171;R&eacute;volution du bon sens 
&#187;, le Parti conservateur 
promettait une r&eacute;duction
de 30 p. 100 du taux d'imposition du revenu et l'&eacute;limination de certaines 
charges sociales, une
coupe de 6 milliards dans les d&eacute;penses pour arriver &agrave; un budget 
&eacute;quilibr&eacute; en cinq ans, la
disparition de 13 000 emplois dans la fonction publique, soit 15 p. 100 de l'effectif 
de
l'administration gouvernementale, et l'annulation de certaines des mesures les plus 
controvers&eacute;es
des N&eacute;o-d&eacute;mocrates : une loi sur l'&eacute;quit&eacute; en 
mati&egrave;re d'emploi fixant des contingents d'emplois
r&eacute;serv&eacute;s aux femmes et &agrave; diverses minorit&eacute;s, un code du 
travail interdisant l'embauche de briseurs
de gr&egrave;ve, et le syst&egrave;me de photo-radar pour contrer l'exc&egrave;s de 
vitesse sur les routes. Les
Conservateurs ont aussi promis de r&eacute;viser le r&eacute;gime d'aide sociale en 
r&eacute;duisant les prestations &agrave; 10
p. 100 au dessus de la moyenne nationale, en imposant des crit&egrave;res 
d'admissibilit&eacute; plus stricts et en
obligeant les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires &agrave; travailler ou &agrave; s'inscrire 
&agrave; des programmes de formation. Ils ont aussi
promis de geler pour cinq ans les tarifs de facturation de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; 
d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; de la province,
Hydro-Ontario.<p>

M. Harris, &acirc;g&eacute; de 50 ans, est originaire de North Bay. Il est le chef du 
Parti depuis 1990. Il a &eacute;t&eacute;
&eacute;lu pour la premi&egrave;re fois au parlement provincial en 1981, apr&egrave;s 
une carri&egrave;re o&ugrave; il a &eacute;t&eacute;
notamment professionnel du golf, administrateur de centre de vill&eacute;giature et 
enseignant. Il a
occup&eacute; le poste de ministre des Ressources naturelles et de ministre de 
l'&Eacute;nergie dans un
gouvernement conservateur ant&eacute;rieur. Au cours de la campagne, il s'est 
engag&eacute; &agrave; d&eacute;missionner si
son gouvernement ne remplissait pas ses promesses.<p>
<h3>
La Saskatchewan r&eacute;&eacute;lit le Parti neo-d&eacute;mocrate</h3>

Le Parti n&eacute;o-d&eacute;mocrate conduit par le premier ministre Roy Romanow a 
&eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;&eacute;lu en
Saskatchewan, le 21 juin, avec une forte majorit&eacute; l&eacute;gislative de 42 
si&egrave;ges sur 58 et 47 p.100 du
vote populaire.<p>

Les Conservateurs, qui &eacute;taient au pouvoir il y a quatre ans, ont 
remport&eacute; 5 si&egrave;ges et les Lib&eacute;raux
11, alors qu'ils n'en avaient eu qu'un seul &agrave; l'&eacute;lection 
ant&eacute;rieure.<p>


&#171;Nous recevons ainsi le mandat sans &eacute;quivoque de poursuivre notre plan touchant 
l'emploi et la
croissance &eacute;conomique... (et de ne plus avoir) les banquiers sur le dos
&#187; , a 
d&eacute;clar&eacute; le premier
ministre Romanow. Les th&egrave;mes de son gouvernement social-d&eacute;mocrate ont 
&eacute;t&eacute;  &#171;l'aust&eacute;rit&eacute;
budg&eacute;taire avec compassion
&#187; , la r&eacute;duction des d&eacute;penses(dont la 
fermeture de 52 h&ocirc;pitaux ruraux)
et l'augmentation des imp&ocirc;ts afin de passer d'un d&eacute;ficit de 842 millions 
de dollars en 1991 &agrave; un
exc&eacute;dent pr&eacute;vu de 119 millions en 1995.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Printer does not print.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
NEC Silentwriter 2 model 90
<h2>Problem</h2>
OS/2 is not recognising rising ACK when BUSY line is high.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Contact author for details of hardware fix.
<h2>Notes</h2>
Earlier this week I was trying to get my NEC silentwriter2 model 90 to 
function.  Looking at the signals I found some interesting information about 
them.  The printer was connected to LPT1.
<p>
OS/2 was sending out the first charecter of the file repeatedly (it turns 
out to be a % sign which is a remark in postscript).  The signal timing for 
the printer was as follows:
strobe signal pulsed low for 10 uS and busy went high.
ack signal fell about 20uS later
Busy went low about 5uS after that
ack went high 5uS later and then the cycle repeated
<p>
This was slightly different from the star NX10 printer that does work with 
OS/2.  The signal timing is as follows:
Strobe pulsed low for 10uS and busy went high
wait for a few uS
Ack pulsed low for 10uS
wait for a few uS
busy went low
<p>
The only difference between the two is that the busy falling edge leads the 
rizing edge of the ack signal.  By only allowing the busy signal to fall 
after the rizing edge of the ACK signal the problem was corrected and the 
printer functions.  If you are interested in the hardware fix I can send it 
to you.
<p>
It looks to me as if OS2 is waiting for the RIZING edge of the ACK signal to 
indicate the information is recieved.  Since it does not see this before the 
printer reads "not busy", OS2 assumes the information was not recieved and 
sends the same charecter again.

Le Bureau de liaison avec les institutions financi&egrave;res
internationales (BLIFI) de l'ambassade du Canada &agrave;
Washington, D.C., aide les entreprises et les organisations
priv&eacute;es canadiennes &agrave; chercher des
d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s commerciaux financ&eacute;s par les deux
institutions financi&egrave;res internationales (IFI) ayant leur
si&egrave;ge &agrave; Washington, &agrave; savoir <a href = "http://www.worldbank.org">la Banque
mondiale </a> et<a href = "http://www.iadb.org"> la Banque interam&eacute;ricaine de
d&eacute;veloppement</a>. Chaque ann&eacute;e, le BLIFI
r&eacute;pond &agrave; des milliers de demandes de renseignements
&agrave; la fois &agrave; caract&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;ral
et sp&eacute;cifique.<p>
<p>
Avant de contacter le BLIFI, les exportateurs canadiens voulant
cibler des march&eacute;s g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par les
pr&ecirc;ts des IFI doivent s'adresser au coordonnateur de
celles-ci dans l'un des centres du commerce international du
Canada (CCI). Ces derniers, dispers&eacute;s &agrave; travers le pays, aident
les exportateurs canadiens, novices et connaisseurs, &agrave; tirer
profit des march&eacute;s d'exportation. Les agents des CCI
offrent un large &eacute;ventail de services commerciaux connexes, et
fournissent des informations commerciales, des conseils
personnalis&eacute;s sur l'exportation, et des liaisons avec les
services des d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s commerciaux &agrave;

<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Installation from CD-ROM drive locks up on Diskette 1 following the
   "Loading, please wait..."  message.
<p>
   Following the message from the Installation Diskette, the OS/2 logo
   appears, there is further diskette and CD-ROM drive activity, the
   screen goes black and the "Loading..."  message appears.  After
   further CD-ROM activity the acreen goes black and the cursor sits
   in the upper left-hand corner (indefinitely).

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   CD-ROM drive

<h2>Problem</h2>

   There is a known problem with the Warp GA IBMKBD.SYS driver which
   can produce this symptom <a href="APARS/PJ16077.html">(APAR PJ16077)</a>.  To verify that your
   symptoms match this APAR, do the following:
<p>
   Add the line SET PROTSHELL = CMD.EXE to your CONFIG.SYS file and
   re-boot.  You should see an OS/2 full-screen command prompt which
   will scroll rapidly, as if the Enter key were being pressed
   repeatedly.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   Replace the Warp GA IBMKBD.SYS driver (5548 bytes, dated 10-03-94)
   with a copy from <a href="ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.edu/os2/warp/patches/">Warp Beta2</a>
   (4677 bytes, dated 7-30-94,).  It may
   also be possible to use the KBD01.SYS driver from OS/2 2.1+XR06200
   (29525 bytes, dated 01-29-94) or the one from 2.1 or 2.11 GA.

<h2>Notes</h2>

   An "updated" version of the IBMKBD.SYS driver was made available
   during the course of Warp Beta testing to fix another problem.
   That driver should &lt;not&gt; be used, as it has the same bug.
<p>
   If this works, please call IBM OS/2 Support and request to be
   added to the IP (Interested Parties) List for APAR PJ16077.

I used the fixed as outlined... however its not quite
accurate for the CD-ROM version... the CD-ROM version
re-installs IBMKBD.SYS from the CD-ROM it appears,
thus clobbering the fix on the Boot Installation Disk,
and thus when you reboot post installation, its
stuffed again.
<p>
My fix was to, at the last possible time, do an F3
(this post the CD-ROM instalation) and do a copy
from the A: installation disk to the C: driver,
then reboot..

<i>

</a>

<p>
Using the 5548-byte 10-03-94 IBMKBD.SYS driver did not help. However, the
<a href="../wfp_03.html">WFP_03 FIXPAK</a> solved the problem using the IBMKBD.SYS driver that is 5544
bytes, dated 12-12-94. The motherboard I installed had a Phoenix BIOS
(version 4.03), as opposed to the AMI devices, and a UMC chipset (8498F and
8496F). I suspect the UMC's might be the root of this problem, since the
AMI BIOS wasn't present, and I have had problems with UMC chipsets in the
past that refused to run Novell NetWare. The hardware I had was:
<p>
<pre>
UM4980 80486 VL-Bus motherboard
Phoenix BIOS version 4.03
UMC 8498F, UMC 8496F (UM8498 Keyboard BIOS)

<h3>Ce que nous faisons pour les entreprises <a name="canadiennes">canadiennes</a></h3>
<p>
La section de l'expansion du commerce et de
l'investissement du groupe de d&eacute;veloppement commercial
international encourage l'exportation de produits et services
canadiens aux &Eacute;tats du milieu de
l'Atlantique des &Eacute;.-U., &agrave; savoir la Pennsylvanie,
le Delaware, le Maryland, la Virginie et le District de Columbia. La
r&eacute;gion du milieu de l'Atlantique se compose de trois
grands march&eacute;s : la vall&eacute;e Delaware (Philadelphie-
Wilmington), le corridor Baltimore-Washington, et l'&Eacute;tat
de Virginie. Certaines des zones m&eacute;tropolitaines
am&eacute;ricaines croissant le plus vite se situent dans cette
r&eacute;gion, et un grand nombre des 500 entreprises
recens&eacute;es par la revue <I>Fortune</I> y ont leurs
si&egrave;ges. La croissance de la r&eacute;gion a permis
&agrave; un fort secteur de ventes au d&eacute;tail de se
maintenir, celles-ci repr&eacute;sentant quelque
10 &#32;p. &#32;100 du total national.<p>
<p>
Les exportations canadiennes vers ce march&eacute;
d&eacute;passaient les 9 &#32;milliards de dollars (Cdn.) en
1994, ce qui correspond &agrave; une hausse de plus de 20 p. 100 par
rapport &agrave; l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente. De
fortes augmentations sont enregistr&eacute;es dans les secteurs de
l'industrie automobile, des produits forestiers, des produits
agro-alimentaires, des biens de consommation et des produits de
t&eacute;l&eacute;communications.<p>
<p>
Nos efforts actuels visent &agrave; d&eacute;velopper les ventes
de services et d'&eacute;quipements de t&eacute;l&eacute;communication, d'ordinateurs
et de logiciels, de produits d'informatique, de produits de soins
de sant&eacute; et d'instruments m&eacute;dicaux, d'articles agro-alimentaires
et de produits et services architecturaux et d'ing&eacute;nierie.
Cela est principalement d&ucirc; &agrave; la forte demande du march&eacute;, &agrave; la
capacit&eacute; des entreprises canadiennes de fournir des
produits comp&eacute;titifs dans ces secteurs, et &agrave; la
pr&eacute;sence de corporations sectorielles et d'associations
commerciales dans la r&eacute;gion.<p>
<p>
La  section de l'expansion du commerce et de
l'investissement aide les entreprises canadiennes &agrave;
obtenir des donn&eacute;es sur les strat&eacute;gies d'exportation, des
informations commerciales, des informations sur les liaisons
r&eacute;gionales et les mod&egrave;les de distribution et de
vente au d&eacute;tail. La Section maintient un liste mise &agrave; jour des
agents commerciaux ayant une exp&eacute;rience de travail avec
les entreprises canadiennes. En outre, elle donne conseil aux
Canadiens pour les aider &agrave; &eacute;laborer un plan de
commercialisation de longue haleine et &agrave; &eacute;tablir
une pr&eacute;sence durable dans le march&eacute; du milieu de
l'Atlantique.<p>
<p>
Les entreprises canadiennes qui remplissent les conditions
requises pourraient b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier du Programme de
d&eacute;veloppement des march&eacute;s d'exportation (PDME) pour
rencontrer des agents prospecteurs, visiter les march&eacute;s et
participer aux manifestation commerciales du milieu de
l'Atlantique.
<p>
<h3>Ce que nous faisons pour les <a name="entreprises">entreprises</a>
am&eacute;ricaines</h3>
<p>
La Section ne m&eacute;nage aucun effort pour fournir des
informations pertinentes et opportunes sur les produits et les
services disponibles au Canada, et ce, en tirant profit des
ressources d'un syst&egrave;me informatis&eacute;,
<I>Exportations WIN</I>, qui contient une base de donn&eacute;es
sur quelque 17 &#32;000 entreprises canadiennes. Dans ce
processus de recherche et de rep&eacute;rage des
d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s, la Section consulte aussi
r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement les sp&eacute;cialistes du secteur
industriel et les associations industrielles et commerciales au
Canada.<p>
<p>
Nous fournissons aux &eacute;ventuels investisseurs
am&eacute;ricains des informations sur le climat d'investissement
au Canada, les d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s, et les personnes-ressources au niveau
f&eacute;d&eacute;ral, provincial et municipal, et dans le
secteur priv&eacute;, y compris sur les financiers et les
prospecteurs de lieux de cr&eacute;ation d'entreprises au Canada.
<p>
<h3><a name="investissements">Investissement</a></h3>
<p>
En remplissant notre mission pour promouvoir l'image du Canada en
tant que lieu propice &agrave; l'investissement, nous sous-
estimons les facteurs suivants qui font que le climat
d'investissement est particuli&egrave;rement attrayant :

<ul type=square>
<li>les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficies des entreprises canadiennes
ont augment&eacute; de 50 &#32;p. &#32;100 en 1994;<br>
<li>la confiance des entreprises est &agrave; son niveau le
plus &eacute;lev&eacute; depuis 15 ans;<br>
<li>l'OCDE pr&eacute;voit qu'en 1995 le Canada arrivera en
t&ecirc;te de liste des pays du G-7 quant &agrave; la croissance
&eacute;conomique;<br>
<li>les capitaux bruts des investissements &eacute;trangers
directs ont plus que doubl&eacute; ces derni&egrave;res
ann&eacute;es;<br>
<li>les exportations continuent d'augmenter, atteignant des
niveaux record;<br>
<li>les taux d'inflation se maintiennent &agrave; un niveau
 r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement bas;<br>
<li>le Canada dispose d'une main-d'oeuvre instruite,
qualifi&eacute;e et loyale, les taux d'absent&eacute;isme et de
renouvellement &eacute;tant bas;<br>
<li>le Canada a une infrastructure de niveau mondial;<br>
<li>En vertu de l'ALENA, les entreprises ayant des
exploitations au Canada ont l'acc&egrave;s imm&eacute;diat
&agrave; un march&eacute; de 360 millions de consommateurs, avec
un PNB de 8,5 mille milliards de dollars.
</ul>
<p>
     Par ailleurs, le gouvernement joue un r&ocirc;le de
responsabilit&eacute; fiscale, en menant une
d&eacute;r&eacute;glementation et une privatisation importantes,
en cr&eacute;ant un climat accueillant pour les entreprises
internationales, en mettant en place des services sociaux et
&eacute;ducatifs de qualit&eacute;, et en maintenant un
r&eacute;gime fiscal comp&eacute;titif en mati&egrave;re de R. et
D.<p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Keyboard doesn't work. Applying fix in Warp Fix Pack # 3 does not fix problem.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
AMI BIOS 40-P101-001437-00101111-072594-GREEN-H
<h2>Problem</h2>
Unknown. 
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Boot the machine without the keyboard plugged in. After it boots,
plug it in.
<h2>Notes</h2>
       You guys ain't gonna like this fix, but it worked for me.
<p>
       My problems came about when I switched to a new GREEN-VLB motherboard.
I had the same annoying symptoms as the other guys with this type of board.
And I also had an old FUJITSU keyboard. Needless to say, I was about to throw
the entire PC out the window...
<p>
       So, I had the idea to let the machine boot WITHOUT the keyboard plugged
in. That way the system couldn't get the "BAD" signal back... Then after OS/2
is done loading, one could then plug the keyboard back in. And guess what, it
works!!!!!! I got keyboard again!!!
<p>
       Obviously, this can only be a temporary fix of this problem 'til the
real thing comes along. Oh, I also forgot, that IBMKBD.SYS dated 09/01/94
doesn't work on the GREEN-VLB boards (at least mine).
<p>
       This is an UGLY, UNELEGANT and straight ARCHAIC temporary solution for
those of us who need to get this thing atleast working. Now I don't know
whether this tactic works for the those having installation problems, but it
just might work!

Mouse pointer displaced - Dell
</title>
<h2>
Mouse pointer displaced - Dell
</h2>
Last Updated: 27th November, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Visible mouse pointer is offset (possibly by several inches) from
   the "effective" internal location for MSWin applications run in
   "seamless" mode (windowed on the OS/2 desktop).

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   Dell Computer systems with MSWin pre-installed.

<h2>Problem</h2>

   This appears to be the result of a Dell-specific version of the
   MSWin MOUSE.DRV driver.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   Obtain a copy of MOUSE.DRV from a standard version of MSWin, or
   download an updated driver from Dell.
<p>
<pre>
   FTP:  dell1.us.dell.com, file <a href="ftp://dell1.us.dell.com/dellbbs/os2/">/dellbbs/os2/mouse.zip</a>
         (possibly ftp.dell.com)
   BBS:  512-728-8528, OS/2 directory, file MOUSE.ZIP
</pre>
<p>
   Rename the current driver (e.g.  to DELMOUSE.DRV) and copy the new
   driver into the MSWin SYSTEM directory (usually named
   \WINDOWS\SYSTEM)

<h2>Notes</h2>

   This has also been reported as a fix for a similar problem for Zeos
   computers.

<h2>Canada is the United States' Best Export Market.</h2>
<p>
In 1993 Canada bought &#36;128.1 billion worth of American merchandise and non-merchandise, 60 percent more than Japan bought and twice as much as the United Kingdom bought.  In fact, the U.S. exported more to the province of Ontario than it did to Japan.  Canada accounted for 17 percent of U.S. exports to the entire world.

WIN-OS2 SESSIONS FAIL TO LAUNCH. BOOTLOG.TXT HAS AS IT,S LAST STATEMENT, "LOADSTART=MOUSE.DRV"

<h3>
WIN-OS2 SESSIONS FAIL TO LAUNCH. BOOTLOG.TXT HAS AS IT,S LAST STATEMENT, "LOADSTART=MOUSE.DRV"
</h3>
Last updated: 27 Dec 1994
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    WIN-OS/2 fails to launch if there is no mouse type specified
    in MOUSE.INI

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    Ensure the MOUSE.INI file has a type specified

</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    When starting any WIN-OS/2 session (FS or Seamless), the session
    will terminate before it starts. If initiated from an ICON, it
    will hatch then unhatch. If initiated from a command line,
    "Loading Please Wait..." will appear, then the session prompt
    will re-display. If starting a WIN-OS/2 session from a command
    line with a "/B" switch, the BOOTLOG.TXT file will show
    LOADSTART=MOUSE.DRV as the last statement in the file. A look
    at MOUSE.INI reveals "MOUSETYPE=". That statement MUST equal the
    type of hardware installed on the system. When running in
    DOS/WINDOWS, the system will query the hardware attached and
    update MOUSE.INI accordingly. This is not occurring in OS/2.
    APAR PJ16247 has been created to address this problem. Until
    a resolution for the problem of why the MOUSE.INI file is not
    being updated as it is in DOS/WINDOWS, ensure the MOUSETYPE=
    statement in MOUSE.INI = &lt;the mouse type described in the
    boot.description section in system.ini&gt;.

<h2>Canada Buys the Most U.S. Goods</h2>
<p>
The United States sold more goods to Canada in 1993 than to any other country -- over %#36;1000 billion worth, up 11 percent over the previous year.  This was more than twice as much as the U.S. sold to Japan in 1993, a country with a population more than four times as great as Canada's 28 million.  U.S. merchandise exports to Canada also exceeded sales to the 12 countrie of the European Union (with a combined population of 348.6 million), which together bought &#36;95 billion worth.

<h2>Canada Buys Its Share of Services.</h2>
<p>
The exchange of services and other non-merchandise transactions is the fastest-growing component of world trade.  The United States is the world's greatest exporter of services, ranging from transportation to computer software, to banking fees to architectural, financial and other expertise.
<p>
Canada is one of the U.S.'s best customers, buying almost &#36;27 billion worth of non-merchandise in 1993.  Of this sum, services accounted for &#36;16.6 billion, while income from U.S. assets in Canada amounted to &#36;10.3 billion.  Canada provided the U.S. with &#36;8.9 billion worth of services, and received &#36;4.2 billion in income on its U.S. assets.
<p>
In recent years the U.S. has regularly had a surplus in services trade while Canada has record a surplus in the exchange of merchandise.<p>

<title>US Current Account Balance</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->
</head>
<body>
<h2>The Current Account is Nearly in Balance</h2>
<p>
Over the decades, the current account between Canada and the United States, the balance of trade in goods and services and income flows, has shifted back and forth.  In every year since 1987, the U.S. has had a small surplus in its current account with Canada, ranging from &#36;1.4 billion in 1993 to &#36;4.9 billion in 1989, because of its edge in services trade and investment income.  This is in marked contrast to the U.S. current account on all of its international transactions, which showed a negative balance of &#36;103.9 billion in 1993.

<title>Impact of the FTA and NAFTA</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->
</head>
<body>
<h2>Canada-U.S. Trade has Boomed Under the FTA and NAFTA</h2>
<p>
The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) liberalizing trade between Canada and the United States went into effect on January 1, 1989.  Between 1988 and 1993, two-way trade in goods, services and income increased by 31 percent.  The expansion has continued in 1994, the first year of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which brought Mexico into the partnership.  After three quarters, U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Canada was up by 12 percent over the same period in 1993.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
Large variety of SYS errors occurring randomly during graphical portion of
installation and normal use of Warp.  Errors are typically of the "Application
can not continue" type.  
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
Hard drive prefetch enabled in PheonixBIOS Version 4.04 (possibly others)
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Warp bypasses the system BIOS and uses its own drivers to control the hard drive.
When the "prefetch" option is turned on in the BIOS, the hard drive returns
unexpected data to Warp, whose drivers aren't aware that prefetch is enabled.
This causes any data read from the hard drive to have a chance of being misread.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Disable the prefetch option in the BIOS.
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
This problem seems to occur most often in Selective Install.

</head>
<body>
<h2>Canada and the U.S. Invest in Each Other's Future.</h2>
<p>
Investment -- both inflows and outflows -- is the key to job creation and international competitiveness.
<p>
The U.S. had &#36;70.4 billion invested directly in Canada at the end of 1993, 13 percent of its total investment abroad.  Almost half - 48 percent - of U.S> direct investment in Canada was in manufacturing.  Finance (other than banking), insurance and real estate attracted 17 percent of the total and the petroleum industry another 13 percent.  The U.S. is by far the largest foreign source of investment in Canada, accounting for 65 percent.

<p>
Canada had &#36;39.4 billion invested in the U.S. at the end of 1993, making it the U.S.'s fourth largest source of foreign capital.  The bulk of Canadian investment in the U.S. was in manufacturing, which accounted for 42 percent of the 1993's yearend total.  Almost a third - 31 percent - was in finance, insurance and real estate, and six percent was in banking.

<title>USR Modems - bad modem ROM causes problems at higher speeds</title>
<h2>USR Modems - bad modem ROM causes problems at higher speeds</h2>
Last Updated: 7th January, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Random and abrupt dropping of carrier signals and other errors.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
USR Sportster and Courier modems connecting to other brands
of V.FastClass (V.FC) modems.
<h2>Problem</h2>
USR modems do not use the Rockwell chipset and when connecting
to other V.FC modems that do, problems can result.
<h2>Fix</h2>
USR has issued a new flash ROM for Couriers (dated 12/02/94) and
is making a new ROM chip for the Sportsers (availability date unknown).
<p>
Contact USR for details. Or click <a href="ftp://ftp.usr.com/">here</a> to visit USR's ftp site.
<h2>Notes</h2>
This is not specifically a Warp problem - it can happen under any operating
system. This note is included here to document the fact that what
you think may be a Warp problem may actually be a problem with
your modem.

<h2>Canada and the U.S. Have a Mutually Beneficial Exchange</h2>
<p>
Since the Canada-U.S. Auto Pact was signed in 1965, the two countries have been involved in an integrated and mutually profitable exchange of autos and auto parts.  In 1993, motor vehicles and parts accounted for a quarter of the United States' merchandise exports and 31 percent of Canada's exports to the U.S.
<p>
The U.S. sells Canada a wide variety of other goods, including &#36;3.1 billion worth of tubes and semi-conductors, &#36;2.1 billion worth of clothing and textiles, &#36;1.7 billion worth of books and other printed materials, &#36;1.7 billion worth of aircraft and parts, &#36;2.2 billion worth of forest products and &#36;1.2 billion owrth of fruits and vegetables, supporting millions of jobs for American workers and farmers.

<h3>US Merchandise Exports to Canada<br>
1993, in billions of US$</h3>

<p>
Canada helped U.S. industry and consumers meet their energy needs in 1993, providing &#36;5.3 billion worth of crude petroleum, &#36;4.5 billion worth of natural gas, &#36;2.7 billion worth of petroleum and coal products, &#36;665 million worth of electricity and &#36;80 million worth of coal.  It also helped keep U.S. factories, offices and farms running by providing such goods as industrial and agricultural machinery (&#36;4.1 billion), office machines (&#36;3 billion) and sophisticated telecommunications equipment (&#36;3.4 billion)

We are a non-profit organisation interested in the Stikine River and its watershed in northwestern BC. The Stikine River is over 400 miles long. Protected in its headwaters in Spatsizi Plateau Provincial Wilderness Park and at its mouth in the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness rea in Alaska, the entire lower half of the river within Canada (most of it) and its chief tributary, the Iskut River, is currently under extreme threat to its ecological integrity from mining and logging proposals, and increased road-building. This is an area having some of the world's largest concentration of large mammals, e.g., grizzly bears, mountain goats, moose, etc. and rare species of many kinds, e.g., marbled murrelets, bald and golden eagles, peregrine falcons, goshawks, and plants and plant communities. Our organisation is currently working very hard to keep the public informed about events in the watershed. We are over 15 years old, have 12 directors, some of whom live in the watershed and who are founding members. The First Nation that lives here is the Tahltan First Nation. For more information, please contact us.

<title>Windows comms program does not recognise modems on COM3</title>
<h2>Windows comms program does not recognise modems on COM3</h2>
Last Updated: 11th February, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When running communications software through a Windows com program, 
OS/2 would not recognize modems at COM3.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
ZOOM FaxModem 28.8
<h2>Problem</h2>
According to IBM, OS/2 reserves IRQ 5 in its system setup for LPT2:.  
IRQ 5 is also used by COM3.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Change com setting on modem to COM1 (best choice).
<h2>Notes</h2>
Nowhere in the Warp manual does it mention this.  I have found that 
many internal modems come preset for COM3 or COM4.  IBM was very helpful 
once I arrived at the correct phone number (not the 800 number listed in the 
customer support section)
<p>
<i>
[ For more information about this situation including alternative solutions, type one or both
of the following commands from the OS/2 command line: 
</i>
<pre>
   VIEW PERFBK "Understanding COM Ports"
   VIEW CMDREF "COM.SYS"

 ERROR DESCRIPTION:
 During the Instllation of OS/2 Warp may cause a system to hang
 on Maintenacne Desktop with a message "Initializing
 Installation Program... Please Wait" if NE2000 card is present.
 The halt may also occur during Selective Install just before it
 gives hard drive information. Cold boot is needed in order to
 recover from hang.
 .
 This problem may cause by following reasons during Instllation.
 1. If network card or any two devices sharing the same IRQ.
 2. If the card is using the port address which is conflicting
 with other device port address.
 3. If the NE2000 card is configured at 300H port address, it
 may not be conflicting but it seems to be one of other device
 driver is defaulting to this address.
 
 
 LOCAL FIX:
 1. OS/2 requires unique Interrupt. Use the unique IRQ for each
 device.
 2. Shouldn't be a conflict in port address either.
 3. Use the different port address for NE2000 card. For example;
 360H, 340H, ETC. Please, refer to owner manual for the card in
 order to move the port address since NET.CFG needs to be
 modified as well.

<p>
I noticed a reference on this page about NE2000's stopping warp
installing.  The fix - just add the following line to your config sys...
<p>
BASEDEV=RESERVE.SYS /IO:320,20 /IRQ:10
<p>
The old NE2000 clones cant handle being probed so this stops OS/2 probing it.

</pre>
<h2>Problem</h2>
Both symptoms result from using the Card and 
Socket Services
drivers that are supplied with Warp. These drivers
are not compatible with the Ethernet card &/or its drivers.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Install the latest Card and Socket Services from IBM:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fetch UTTPS200.EXE from the IBM PC Company's
FTP server:<p><pre>   </pre><a href="ftp://ftp.pcco.ibm.com/pub/mobiles/">ftp://ftp.pcco.ibm.com/pub/mobiles/</a>
<p>
<li>Run the self extracting zip
<p>
<li>Make the 2nd disk:
<pre>
LOADDSKF UTTP20-2.DSK A:
</pre>
<li>Run the installation program PCMINST2.EXE
<p>
<li>Check that similar lines to the following are at or near the
bottom of CONFIG.SYS. 
<p>
<pre>
DEVICE=\THINKPAD\PCMCIA.SYS
DEVICE=\THINKPAD\VPCMCIA.SYS
DEVICE=\THINKPAD\AUTODRV2.SYS \THINKPAD\AUTODRV2.INI
DEVICE=\THINKPAD\IBM2SS01.SYS /C1=9
</pre>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
Aside from the problems above, I also experienced
failure of the loopback diagnostic test. The manual
that accompanies the card suggests replacing the card.
I did this and experienced the same problem. It turned out
that the problem was actually a dud 50 ohm terminator (not supplied
by IBM). When I replaced the 50 ohm terminator, the loopback
test passed.
<p>
So, if the loopback diagnostics fail for you, check your T-connectors 
and terminators. If you have spares handy, try them.
If you don't, use a multimeter
to check the resistance 
between the core and the case of the T-connector when both the terminators are
attached to it. A good set of terminators and T-connector will measure 
25 ohms (e.g. half of 50 ohms). If it measures 50 ohms, either the
T-connector, or one of the terminators needs to be replaced.

<p>
Finally, people new to Ethernet cabling (such as myself!) 
may not realise that the following cabling configuration for a 2 
machine network is incorrect, even though it makes 
sense "geometrically".
<p>
<pre>
WRONG:

        F---- Coax Cable ----F
        |                    |
        M                    M
      Card                  Card
      
      Where:
      
        M - male coax connector
        F - female coax connector
      
</pre>
<p>
T-connectors must be used. The reason is that
a thin coax cable needs a 50 ohm load on each end. This
can only be achieved if T-connectors are used.
<p>
<pre>
RIGHT:

     T M+M F---- Coax Cable ----F M+M T
        F                          F
        |                          |
        M                          M
      Card                        Card
     
     Where:
     
        M   - male coax connector
        F   - female coax connector
        T   - 50 ohm terminator

       M+M  - T-connector
        F

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
Install Hangs after reboot, before System Setup screen appears
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
Toshiba 2150CD series laptop computers
(486 DX4-75, built in IDE CDROM, etc)
<pre>
Toshiba 2150CDS
</pre>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
The computer was hanging after the install rebooted, but before
the System Setup screen appeared.  Reboots did not fix the problem,
reinstallations did not fix the problem.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Try Disabling the sound card in BIOS.<p>
1. Reboot the computer<p>
2. Hold down the ESC key<p>
3. Go to the Sound card setting, hit the spacebar until it says "Disabled"<p>
4. Press the END key, then "Y"<p>
5. See if the install proceeds.
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
This is allowed my laptop's installation to proceed, it may have
been a coincidence that the install proceeded, but it did work
after I disabled the sound card.  You can reenable the sound card
after installation and install multimedia support.
this problem occured on OS/2 Warp for windows (no Win-OS/2 support).
Warp Connect fixes this problem.

<P>
The Office for Liaison with International Financial Institutions (OLIFI), located at the  Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., assists Canadian firms and private sector organizations in their pursuit of business opportunities financed by the two Washington-based International Financial Institutions (IFIs): <a href = "http://www.worldbank.org"> the World Bank</a> and <a href = "http://www.iadb.org">the Inter-American Development Bank</a>.  Each year, OLIFI responds to thousands of enquiries, of both a general and specific nature.<p>

Before contacting OLIFI, Canadian exporters interested in targeting markets generated by IFI lending should approach the IFI coordinator in one of Canada's International Trade Centres (ITCs).  ITCs, located across the country, help new and experienced Canadian exporters take advantage of export markets.  ITC officers perform a wide range of trade-related services, and provide market information and intelligence, one-on-one export counselling, and a link with the Canadian Trade Commissioner Service abroad, including OLIFI.<p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
After installation, CDROM unavailable
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
Toshiba 2150CD series laptop computers
(486 DX4-75, built in IDE CDROM, etc)
<pre>
Toshiba 2150CDS
</pre>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
After installation, the system couldn't recognize the CDROM.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Edit the Config.SYS.  Look for the line:
<pre>
    BASEDEV=IBM2TOS1.SYS /s0=2 /c0=15
</pre>
Change the /c0=15 to /c0=# where # is a free IRQ (11?).
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
The /C0=# appears to be reserving an IRQ for the PCMCIA driver,
therefore, this will only affect you if you've installed PCMCIA support.
The default IRQ for the driver on my machine was IRQ 15, the second
IDE channel (hence the CDROM).  Sense the BASEDEV statements load
before the CDROM filters (IBMIDE.FLT) the filter couldn't locate the CDROM.
<p>
This problem did not occur in OS/2 Warp Connect.
<p>
<strong>
Don't forget to make a backup of your config.sys! I'm not responsible for
system damage or data loss

 ERROR DESCRIPTION:
 When starting Under a Killing Moon from Access Software from a
 Dos Fullscreen session ( MOON.EXE ) a Black Screen is produced.
 The game just hangs with no change in the video. This has been
 reproducable here in BOCA under OS/2 2.11 and OS/2 WARP 3.0.
 
 Enviroment:
 .
 OS/2 Warp 3.0 or OS/2 2.11
 .
 Dos Full Screen Settings:
 .
 Audio Adapter Sharing: On
 DOS_HIGH: On
 DOS_UMB: On
 DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT: 64
 EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT: 4096
 HW_TIMER: On
 Idle_seconds: 60
 Idle_sens..: 100
 Int_during_io: on
 Video XGA 8514 IO trap: OFF
 Video Retrace Emulation: OFF
 XMS MEMORY: 4096
 .
 .
 Hardware:
 .
 486 DX2 66 mhz. Eisa
 Diamond Stealth Pro 2meg and Viper 2meg VLB
 Media Vision Pro Audio Studio / Sound Blaster AWE 32
 Bus Logic 32 bit SCSI adapter.
 Toshiba 3401 external CDROM.
 Reel Magic Mpeg card.
 Jovian Super VIA ( Video Capture card)
 .
 I don't think that it is sound card dependent.
 .
 However thee DEMO of the game will run under OS/2 2.11 and OS/2
 WARP 3.0 with sound. The GA released will not run at all.
 
 
 LOCAL FIX:
 Workaround: Possible suggestion: Configure the game not to use
 any sound at all.

<h1>Canada</h1>
<hr>
</center>

<h3>Land Mass</h3>
<P>
At 9 970 610 km&#178;, Canada is the world's second-largest country.<P>
<P>
<h3>Capital</h3><P>
Ottawa, in the province of Ontario.<P>
<P>
<h3>Provinces and Territories</h3><P>
Canada has 10 provinces and 2 territories, each with its own capital city (in
brackets): Alberta (Edmonton); British Columbia (Victoria); Prince Edward Island
(Charlottetown); Manitoba (Winnipeg); New Brunswick (Fredericton); Nova Scotia
(Halifax); Ontario (Toronto); Quebec (Quebec City); Saskatchewan (Regina);
Newfoundland (St. John's); Northwest Territories (Yellowknife) and Yukon Territory
(Whitehorse).<P>
<P>
<h3>Geography</h3><P>
Diversity is the keynote of Canada's geography, which includes fertile plains
suitable for agriculture, vast mountain ranges, lakes and rivers.  Wilderness forests
give way to arctic tundra in the Far North.<P>
<P>
<h3>Climate</h3><P>
There are of course many climatic variations in this huge country, ranging from the
permanently frozen icecaps north of the 70th parallel to the luxuriant vegetation of
British Columbia's west coast.  On the whole, though, Canada has four very
distinct seasons, especially in the regions lying along the U.S. border.  <P>
<P>
Daytime summer temperatures can rise to 35 &#186;C and higher, while lows of -
25 are not uncommon in winter.  More moderate temperatures are the norm in
spring and fall.
<P>
<h3>National Parks and Historic Sites</h3><P>
The Canadian government has set aside more than 100 national parks and historic
sites in honour of the people, places and events that have marked the country's
history.  Similarly, the provincial governments may form provincial parks. <P>
<P>
Canada's 37 national parks are spread throughout the country.  Banff, located on
the eastern slopes of Alberta's Rocky Mountains, is the oldest, having opened in
1885, while Vuntut in the northern Yukon was established as recently as 1993.
<P>
<P>
<h3>Mountain Ranges</h3><P>
As one might expect, Canada's terrain incorporates a number of mountain ranges:
the Torngats, Appalachians and Laurentians in the east; the Rocky, Coastal and
 Mackenzie ranges in the west; and Mount St. Elias and the Pelly Mountains in the
north.  At 6050 m, Mount Logan in the Yukon is Canada's tallest peak.<P>
<P>
<h3>Lakes</h3><P>
The main lakes, in order of the surface area located in Canada, (many large lakes
are traversed by the Canada-U.S. border) are Huron, Great Bear, Superior, Great
Slave, Winnipeg, Erie and Ontario.  Great Bear Lake in the Northwest Territories is
the largest lake situated entirely in Canada; its area is 31 326 km&#178;.<P>
<P>
<h3>Rivers</h3><P>
The St. Lawrence River, which is 3058 km long, provides a seaway for ships from
the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.  The Mackenzie is the longest river, flowing
4241 km through the Northwest Territories.  The Yukon and the Columbia, parts of
which flow through U.S. territory, the Nelson, the Saskatchewan, the Peace and
the Churchill are also major watercourses.<P>
<P>
<h3>Time Zones</h3><P>
Canada has six time zones.  The easternmost, in Newfoundland, is three hours and
30 minutes behind Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  The other time zones are the
Atlantic, the Eastern, the Central, the Rocky Mountain and, farthest west, the
Pacific, which is eight hours behind GMT.<P>
<P>
<h3>Political System<P>
</h3>Canada is a constitutional monarchy and a federal state with a democratic
parliament.  The Parliament of Canada, in Ottawa, consists of the House of
Commons, whose members are elected, and the Senate, whose members are
appointed.  On average, members of Parliament are elected every four years.<P>
<P>
<h3>National Emblem</h3><P>
The maple leaf has been associated with Canada since the 1700s.  It has become
the country's most important symbol since the national flag was introduced in
1965.<P>
<P>
<h3>National Anthem</h3><P>
<I>O Canada</I> was proclaimed the national anthem on July 1, 1980, a
century after being sung for the first time.<P>
<P>
<h3>Currency</h3><P>
The Canadian dollar is divided into 100 cents.<P>
<P>
<h3>Population</h3><P>
At the time of the June 1991 census, Canada's population was 27.3 million.<P>
<p>
<h3>Main Cities</h3><P>
According to the 1991 census, the leading Canadian cities are Toronto (3.89
million), Montreal (3.12 million), Vancouver (1.60 million), Ottawa-Hull, the
National Capital Region (0.92 million) and Edmonton (0.84 million).<P>
<P>
<h3>Urban and Rural Population</h3><P>
The majority of Canadians, 76.6 percent, live in cities and towns, while 23.4
percent live in rural areas.  According to the 1991 census, 31 percent of the
population (8.61 million people) live in the three largest cities of Toronto, Montreal
and Vancouver.<P>
<P>
<h3>Life Expectancy</h3><P>
Women can expect to live almost 80 years, and men, 73, years according to 1991
data.<P>
<P>
<h3>Family Size</h3><P>
At the time of the 1991 national census, the average family size was 3.1, including
1.3 children.<P>
<P>
<h3>Living Standard</h3><P>
Canada has one of the world's highest living standards.  For example, in 1991, 83
percent of Canadian households had at least one car; 97.5 percent had colour
televisions, and one out of five had a computer. <P>
<P>
<h3>Health Care and Social Security</h3><P>
All Canadians have free access to health care, with the exception of dental
services.  Most people over 65 and social aid recipients receive the majority of their
prescription drugs free of charge.  Canada also has an extensive social security
network, including old age pension, family allowance, unemployment insurance and
welfare.<P>
<P>
<h3>Native Peoples</h3><P>
In 1991, 533 000 Canadians were either status or non-status Indians, and over
one million claimed to be of native descent: of these, 783 980 were North
American Indians, 212 650 were M&eacute;tis and 49 255 were Inuit (formerly
called Eskimos).<P>
<P>
Ontario had the highest concentration of natives -- 243 550 -- but the Northwest
Territories had the highest proportion: more than 60 percent of its population is of
native descent.<P>
<P>
Only 295 032 Canadian natives live on reserves or in native settlements.<P>
<p>
<h3>Religion</h3><P>
The majority of Canadians are Christian.  According to the 1991 census, Roman
Catholicism has the most adherents (54.2 percent of Canadians), followed by
Protestantism.  Other religions include Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism and
Buddhism.  About 3.4 million people stated that they had no religious affiliation
whatsoever.<P>
<P>
<h3>Languages</h3><P>
English, the mother tongue of 16.1 million Canadians, and French, the language of
6.5 million, are Canada's two official languages.  However, many Canadians have a
mother tongue other than English or French, including Italian, Chinese, German,
Portuguese, Polish, Ukrainian, Dutch, Greek or other languages.<P>
<P>
<h3>Ethnic Origin</h3><P>
Canadians, including natives, who claim something other than British or French as
their origin represent 42 percent of the population, or 11 million people.  Among
the largest ethnic are the German, Italian, Ukrainian, Dutch, Polish, Chinese, South
Asian, Jewish, West Indian, Portuguese and Scandinavian.<P>
<P>
<h3>Culture</h3><P>
The native culture is the only truly indigenous culture of Canada, since all other
Canadians were originally immigrants.  They began moving to Canada in the 17th
century, bringing with them their manner of dress, food preferences and customs. 
Canada opened its doors to immigration from all over the world in the early 20th
century; in 1988, the multicultural character of the country was officially
recognized when the Government passed the Multiculturalism Act.<P>
<P>
<h3>Education</h3><P>
The educational system varies from province to province and includes six to eight
years of elementary school, four or five years of secondary school and three or four
years at the university undergraduate level.  The 1991 census revealed that among
Canadians aged 15 and over, 56.9 percent had attended secondary school, 31.7
percent had gone to a trade school or other type of post-secondary institution, and
1.9 million -- 11.4 percent of the population -- had a university degree. <P>
<P>
<h3>Sports</h3><P>
The most popular sports in Canada include swimming, ice hockey, cross-country
and alpine skiing, baseball, tennis, basketball and golf.  Ice hockey, Canadian
football and baseball are the favourite spectator sports.<P>
<P>
<h3>Main Natural Resources</h3><P>
The principal natural resources are natural gas, oil, gold, coal, copper, iron ore,
nickel, potash, uranium and zinc, along with wood and water.<p>

<h3>Gross Domestic Product</h3><P>
The GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by a country
during a year.  Canada's GDP was C$ 688.5 billion Canadian dollars in 1992.<P>
<P>
<h3>Leading Industries</h3><P>
These include automobile manufacturing, pulp and paper, iron and steel work,
machinery and equipment manufacturing, mining, extraction of fossil fuels, forestry
and agriculture.<P>
<P>
<h3>Exports</h3><P>
Canada's leading exports are automobile vehicles and parts, machinery and
equipment, high-technology products, oil, natural gas, metals, and forest and farm
products.<P>
<P>
<h3>Imports<P>
</h3>Canada imports machinery and industrial equipment including
communications and electronic equipment, vehicles and automobile parts, industrial
materials (metal ores, iron and steel, precious metals, chemicals, plastics, cotton,
wool and other textiles), along with manufactured products and food.

<title>Fact Sheet:  Newfoundland and Labrador</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->

<p>
<h1>Newfoundland and Labrador</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<h3>The Land </h3><P>
<P>
Nestled into the northeast corner of North America, facing the North Atlantic, is
Newfoundland, Canada's most easterly province.  Lying between the 46th and
61st parallels, the province consists of two distinct geographical entities:
Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
The island of Newfoundland, which forms the southern and eastern portion of the
province, is a large triangular-shape area of some 112 000 km<em sup>2</em>,
while the province's total area is 405 720 km<em sup>2</em>.  Located at the
mouth of the St. Lawrence River, the island is about halfway between the centre of
North America and the coast of western Europe.  The island of Newfoundland is
separated from the Canadian mainland by the Strait of Belle Isle in the north and by
the wider Cabot Strait in the south.  The mainland, Labrador, is bordered by
northeastern Quebec. Approximately two and a half times as large as the island, it
remains a vast, pristine wilderness, where the northern lights, or <I>aurora
borealis</I>, flicker over the largest caribou herd in the world.
<P>
The province's coastline, stretching over more than 17 000 km, is varied and
scenic with its bold headlands, deep fiords and countless small coves and offshore
islands.  The interiors of both Labrador and Newfoundland have a rolling, rugged
topography, deeply etched by glacial activity and broken by lakes and swift-flowing
rivers.  Much of the island and southern and central Labrador is covered by a thick
boreal forest of black spruce and balsam fir mixed with birch, tamarack and balsam
poplar.  Northern Labrador is largely devoid of forest and is marked by the
spectacular Torngat Mountains, which rise abruptly from the sea to heights of up
to 1676 m. 
<P>
Newfoundland's climate can best be described as moderate and maritime.  The
island enjoys winters that are surprisingly mild by Canadian standards, though with
a high rate of precipitation.  Labrador, by comparison, has the cold winters and
brief summers characteristic of the Canadian mid-North.<P>
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The central region of the island of Newfoundland was once the home of the now
extinct Beothuk Indians.  The first Europeans to visit Newfoundland were
Norsemen, who arrived in the late 10th century.  (The Norse settlement at l'Anse
aux Meadows was the world's first cultural discovery location to receive
recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.)  Other early visitors, the Basques,
Portuguese, Spanish, British and French, staged fishing expeditions in the 16th
century and probably even earlier.  <p>

In 1497, the Italian seafarer Giovanni Caboto (John Cabot) went to investigate
what lay in the northern section of the western Atlantic.  John Cabot landed on the
island on June 24, 1497, on the feast of St. John the Baptist. Cabot called the
new land "St. John's Isle" in honour of the saint, and claimed it for Henry VII of
England, his patron and employer.
<P>
Anglo-French colonial warfare shaped the history of Newfoundland during the
1600s and 1700s.  France, already well-established on the mainland of Eastern
Canada, began to make claims to parts of Newfoundland.  In 1662, France
established a fort and colony at Placentia, despite protests from British merchants
and fishermen.  The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 ended a long period of raids and
skirmishes by both nations, and reconfirmed British sovereignty over Newfoundland
and the fishing banks.
<P>
The people of Newfoundland were granted the right to vote for an elected
assembly in 1832 and, after much debate, Newfoundland was given responsible
government in 1855.  In 1865, Newfoundland postponed the decision on whether
to join the Dominion of Canada.  Following World War II, the question of
Newfoundland's future status became an issue once again.  It was decided to hold
a public referendum on the subject and, in 1948, Newfoundlanders voted in favour
of joining the Canadian Confederation.  Newfoundland became Canada's newest
province on March 31, 1949. 
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
The province's present population of 570 000 is largely descended from settlers
from southwestern England and southern Ireland, who immigrated to
Newfoundland in the late 1700s and early 1800s.  The pattern of settlement was
mainly determined by the fishing industry, a population distribution that has
persisted to this day.  The Avalon Peninsula and northeastern Newfoundland, the
traditional base for the fisheries, continue to be the most heavily populated
areas.
<P>
St. John's, the historic commercial centre and capital of the island, is the
province's largest city, with a population of approximately 172 000.  Other major
centres are Grand Falls, Windsor and Corner Brook.  The smaller communities --
called outports -- remain, nevertheless, a major element in Newfoundland society.
The twin towns of Labrador City and Wabush, which together form the largest
urban community of Labrador, are based on the iron-ore mining industries of the
area.
<P>
In the early 1800s, disease and conflicts with settlers reduced the Beothuk Indians
to extinction.  There were, and still are, a relatively large number of Inuit
concentrated in the coastal communities of northern Labrador.<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<p>
Since its first settlement, Newfoundland and Labrador has been highly dependent
on its resource sector.  The province was initially settled because of its rich fishing
grounds on the "nose" and "tail" of the Grand Banks.  The mainstay of the
province's fishing industry has been groundfish (primarily cod); however, other
important catches are flounder, redfish, capelin, shrimp and crab.  
<P>
Protection of the rich fishery resources off the coast of Newfoundland has been an
ongoing concern which has intensified in recent years.  In 1977, the Canadian
government extended its fishery jurisdiction to 200 miles around the coast of the
province in an attempt to gain better control of fishing activity.  This move
produced positive results in the 1980s, but in 1989 scientific studies revealed that,
due to a number of factors, some of the Atlantic's key groundfish stocks were in
severe decline.  Since that period, there have been successive reductions in
quotas. 
<P>
The second prominent aspect of the provincial economy is the mining industry. 
This industry ships mineral products valued at approximately $700 million a year,
mostly iron ore from Labrador.  Other minerals mined in the province are gold,
asbestos, limestone and gypsum. 
<P>
The third significant traditional goods-producing industry is the newsprint industry. 
This industry consists primarily of three pulp and paper mills located in Comer
Brook, Grand Falls and Stephenville, which have undergone extensive
rationalization and modernization over the past decade.
<P>
Recently, the discovery of offshore oil and gas reserves has added a new
dimension to the marine resources of the province.  The Hibernia discovery in 1979
was Newfoundland's first significant oil find; reserves are estimated at 615 million
barrels.  Currently under way, Hibernia is the largest construction project in North
America. 
<P>
The province's largest utility industry is electric power.  The largest hydroelectric
facility is located in Churchill Falls, Labrador, with a total installed capacity of 5
403 megawatts.
<P>
In addition to fish products and pulp and paper products, about half of the
province's manufacturing gross domestic product comes from other resource and
non-resource-based manufacturing.  Numerous companies are engaged in the
manufacture of items such as boats, lumber, chemical and oil-based products, food
and beverages, clothing and footwear.  In total, the province shipped about $1.4
billion in manufactured products in 1992.
<P>
Newfoundland's agriculture industry is small compared with other Canadian
provinces.  The output of the agriculture industry is mainly for domestic
consumption, although some agricultural products such as blueberries and furs are
sold to markets outside the province.<p>

Newfoundland's service sector has experienced substantial growth over the years:
in 1992, the service sector accounted for over two thirds of provincial gross
domestic product.
<P>
In recent years, Newfoundland's efforts to develop a solid tourism industry have
intensified.  The province's rich cultural and historical heritage and unique character
are considered to be major selling features to other Canadians and travellers from
around the world.   It is estimated that between 265 000 and 300 000 people visit
the province each year, spending an estimated $400 million annually.<P>

load the document.  This does <strong>not</strong> appear to work if AmiPro is
running in anything but a full-screen Windows session.  To fix the
problem, change the Settings of your AmiPro program icon, change Session
settings to full-screen Windows.
<p>
A usability issue that affects all Windows programs (not just
AmiPro) is that OS/2 ignores the default directory setting of 
Windows program objects. One way to ensure that AmiPro
starts up in a specific directory is to use
AmiPro's Tools/User Setup/Paths menu to configure the 
default startup directory.

<h1>New Brunswick</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
New Brunswick borders on Nova Scotia, Quebec and the U.S. state of Maine.  It is
almost rectangular in shape, extending 322 km north to south and 242 km east to
west.  It is more or less surrounded by water on three sides.
<P>
New Brunswick has a land mass of 73 500 km<em sup>2</em>, 85 percent of
which is forest.  The northern part of the province is quite mountainous, the tallest
peak being Mount Carleton, 820 m high.  The interior consists mainly of a rolling
plateau, flatter in the east and more hilly in the southeast.
<P>
The main rivers are the Miramichi, Nepisguit, Restigouche and Saint John.  Known
as "oa-lus-tuk" or "beautiful river" to the Indians, the Saint John waters the fertile
lands of the western part of the province over a distance of 725 km.  Downstream,
in the Madawaska area, it traces a natural boundary between the state of Maine
and Canada.
<P>
Twice a day, with the rising tide of the Atlantic Ocean, 100 billion tonnes of water
stream past a rocky headland in the Bay of Fundy.  The current created is
practically equal to the flow of all the world's rivers over a 24-hour period.  The
eastern end of the Bay has tides of nearly 15 m, the highest in the world, sufficient
to completely submerge a four-storey building.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The existence of New Brunswick was known to the Europeans as early as the
1400s, when intrepid Basque fishermen plied their trade off Miscou in the
northeast of the province.  At that time, the region was inhabited by the Malecite
and Micmac Indians.  The Micmacs were the first to receive Samuel de Champlain
and the French when they landed in New Brunswick in 1604.  The Indians
established good relations with the French from the outset, helping the French
settlers, known as Acadians, to adapt to their new country and taking part in the
French attacks on New England.
<P>
The British and French feuded over the area for a century.  Control passed back
and forth until 1713, when all of Acadia was ceded to the British under the Treaty
of Utrecht.  With time, France lost interest in the Acadians, turning most of its
attention to New France and the burgeoning fur trade.
<P>
By 1755, England had established its dominance as a colonial power.  Fearing that
the Acadians were a security threat, the British deported , mainly to the United
States, all Acadians who would not swear allegiance to the British Crown.  Their
 exile lasted eight years, after which a significant proportion returned to their
homeland.
<P>
In 1783, the western part of Nova Scotia became the home of thousands of
Loyalists who had taken flight in the aftermath of the American Revolution.  These
American colonists, wishing to remain faithful to the British Crown, founded
communities in the northern part of the province.  This mass influx of Loyalists
created a rift between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, and New Brunswick
became a separate province in June, 1784.  In 1867 it joined other provinces to
form the Dominion of Canada.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
In 1991, the population of New Brunswick was 723 900.  With the highest
percentage of Francophones outside Quebec (almost 35 percent), New Brunswick
is Canada's only officially bilingual province.
<P>
The heritage of New Brunswick's people is a blended one, combining elements of
the French, British Loyalist, Scots and Irish traditions, with later elements of
German, Scandinavian and Asian.  The little municipality of New Denmark boasts
North America's largest Danish colony.
<P>
The aboriginal people of New Brunswick number more than 12 000, most of them
Micmac and Malecite.
<P>
The coasts and river valleys are the areas of heaviest population; Saint John is the
largest city, followed by Moncton and Fredericton, the provincial capital.<P>
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Leading the manufacturing industries are food and beverages, followed by pulp and
paper, sawmills, manufacturers of furniture and other wood-based industries, metal
processing, transportation equipment, processing of non-metallic ores and primary
metals.
<P>
Tourism is a vital part of the province's economy.  In 1991, nearly 1.5 million
people visited the New Brunswick's tourists attractions, including its two national
parks and numerous provincial parks.
<P>
New Brunswick has an abundance of natural resources.  Forests occupy 85 percent
of the land mass; consequently, wood and wood products are a cornerstone of the
economy, with black spruce and fir leading the list.  Mining, too, is important; New
Brunswickers mine silver, bismuth, cadmium, coal, copper, natural gas, gold, oil,
lead, potash, peat, tungsten, silica, salt and zinc.
<p>
Fishing and agriculture are also very important.  More than 50 varieties of fish and
shellfish are caught here; in fact, the town of Shediac has been called the "lobster
capital of the world."  In agriculture, New Brunswick is self-sufficient in the
production of forage, milk and poultry.  Its potatoes are renowned in over 25
countries; strawberries, apples, blueberries and vegetables are produced for local
consumption and for export.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When doing an install MS Windows support with  Warp Without WinOS2, the 
OS/2 install asks for various Windows Diskettes.  A CD-ROM with the Windows 
install files is available.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Any PC with a CD-ROM that is supported during the initial OS/2 install or
selective install.
<h2>Problem</h2>
The Warp Without WinOS2 install process generally requires MS Windows
install diskettes in order to support MS Windows.  User has MS Windows 
install files on a CD-ROM.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
When The OS/2 install process requests the first MS Windows install diskette,
it will display a pop-up window with a default prompt of "A:\".  Put the
MS Windows CD-ROM in the PC's CD-ROM player and determine the location of
the Windows install files.  Then change the default value in the popup
window to the drive and path of the Windows install files on the CD.  For
example, if the CD drive is E: and the MS Windows install files are in the
\Windows directory, then change the "A:\" to "E:\windows". 
<p>
After changing the prompt in the popup window, press the enter key. The 
install program will beep at you and tell you to install the next diskette 
in your CD-ROM drive, simply hit enter (or change directories and hit 
enter--if the MS Windows install files are not in a single directory) the 
install program will find the files it needs if they are in the directory 
you point it to.
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
I have seen several CD-ROMs from Dell and Gateway that were shipped with
the MS Windows install files.  In these cases, the files were all in the
\windows directory off the root.  Another scheme may be to have each
set of install files in a directory corresponding to the install diskette.
For example, \windows\disk_1, \window\disk_2, \windows\disk_3, etc. In 
is case, you will need to change directories in the install prompt each 
time the install program asks you to.

<title>Fact Sheet:  Nova Scotia</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->

<p>
<h1>Nova Scotia</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
Nova Scotia's 580-km-long peninsula is surrounded by four bodies of water -- the
Atlantic Ocean, the Bay of Fundy, the Northumberland Strait and the Gulf of St.
Lawrence.  Its geographic location, together with large, ice-free, deep-water
harbours, has been a key factor in the province's economic development.
<P>
With an area of 55 &#32;491 <em sup></em>km<em sup>2</em>, Nova Scotia is
larger than Denmark, although somewhat smaller than Scotland, after which it is
named.  Its average width of 128 km means that no part of the province is far from
the sea.
<P>
Nova Scotia is a mosaic of rugged headlands, tranquil harbours and ocean beaches. 
Its indented shoreline stretches 10 &#32;424 km, while inland is a myriad of lakes
and streams.  The land is framed by the rocky Atlantic Uplands, the Cape Breton
Highlands and the wooded Cobequid Hills.  The agricultural areas of Nova Scotia
are predominantly lowlands.  When the glacial ice withdrew from coastal Nova
Scotia 15 &#32;000 to 18 &#32;000 years ago, the ocean flooded ancient river
valleys and carved out hundreds of small protected harbours which later became
fishing ports.
<P>
Nova Scotia lies in the northern temperate zone and, although it is almost
surrounded by water, the climate is continental rather than maritime.  The
temperature extremes of a continental climate, however, are moderated by the
ocean. 
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The Micmac Indians inhabited Nova Scotia long before the first explorers arrived
from Europe.  The first visitors were Norsemen in the early 11th century, and, in
1497, Italian explorer John Cabot had noted the rich fishing grounds in the area. 

<P>
In the 17th century, all of Nova Scotia, as well as parts of Quebec, New Brunswick
and Maine, which made up an area known as Acadia, was settled by the French. 
Pierre de Monts established the first successful agricultural settlement in Canada,
at Port Royal in 1605.  In the next century, the British and the French feuded over
the area. Control passed back and forth until 1713, when all of Acadia was ceded
to the British under the Treaty of Utrecht.
<P>
Conflict between Britain and France continued.  The Acadians, mainly settlers from
France, tried to convince both sides of their neutrality, but by 1755 the British had 
decided that the Acadians posed too great a security threat.  They expelled all
Acadians who would not swear allegiance to the British Crown.  Many returned to
 France, some settled in New France and many others moved to the United States.
<P>
In 1783, thousands of United Empire Loyalists from the newly independent New
England states immigrated to Nova Scotia.  They wanted to remain British despite
the formation of the United States of America.  The influx of the Loyalists doubled
Nova Scotia's population; and in 1784, it was partitioned to create the colonies of
New Brunswick and Cape Breton Island.
<P>
In 1848, largely through the efforts of newspaper owner and patriot Joseph Howe,
Nova Scotia became the first British colony to win responsible government.  Nova
Scotia was one of the four provinces that constituted the new federation called the
Dominion of Canada in 1867.  At that time, the province was in the forefront of
international shipbuilding, and the lumber and fish trades.  Confederation helped to
finance the railroad to Quebec City, which opened the province to the interior of
the continent.  The first and second world wars emphasized the importance of
Halifax, Nova Scotia's capital, as a staging point for convoys and confirmed it as
one of the world's major military ports.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
Over 80 percent of Nova Scotia's population of 920 000 trace their ancestry either
wholly or partly to the British Isles.  Those with French origin rank second: 18
percent of residents have some French ancestry.   The next largest groups by
ancestry are German and Dutch.
<P>
Residents of Nova Scotia are also of Polish, Italian, Jewish and Lebanese descent.
After the War of 1812, several thousand Blacks, including the Chesapeake Blacks,
settled in the Halifax area; today over 15 000 residents of the province have Black
origins.  More recent immigrants to Nova Scotia have included Chinese, Indo-
Chinese, African, Asian and eastern European groups.
<P>
Almost 22 &#32;000 residents of Nova Scotia have Aboriginal origins, and
primarily belong to the Micmac Nation.
<P>
The largest concentrations of population are found in the Halifax metropolitan area
with a population of 320 &#32;000 and the Sydney urban area with
116 &#32;000.  Major towns include Yarmouth, Kentville, Bridgewater, Truro,
Amherst and New Glasgow.<p>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Nova Scotia's economy is highly diversified, having evolved from resource-based
employment to include many types of manufactured goods as well as business and
personal services.
<P>
The resources sector started with the sea and the teeming fish of the Scotian
 Shelf.  This resource, particularly cod, has been hit by dwindling stocks in recent
years, and quotas are affecting those who derive their livelihood from this sector. 
In 1992, approximately 20 &#32;000 workers were directly employed in fishing
and fish processing and many more jobs were indirectly created by activity in the
sector.  The catch is composed mainly of cod, haddock and pollock, as well as
lobsters, scallops and crab.
<P>
For a small province, Nova Scotia has a highly developed forestry sector with four
pulp and paper mills and several hundred sawmills.  
<P>
The mining sector is dominated by coal production of four million tonnes.  The
province also produces 5.3 million tonnes of gypsum, over 85 percent of the
Canadian total.  Other mining activity includes salt, barite, crushed stone, peat and
sand and gravel.  Extensive exploration of offshore oil and gas has been undertaken
in the past decade, and in 1991 the first commercial production of oil began near
Sable Island.
<P>
Nova Scotia has a highly specialized commercial agriculture sector.  Dairy is the
largest sector, followed by horticultural crops, poultry, eggs, beef cattle and hogs. 
Export commodities include blueberries, apples and processed fruits, vegetables
and juices. 
<P>
Tourism is an important sector in the provincial economy.  Total tourism receipts
exceed $800 million and over 30 &#32;000 are employed in the many aspects of
the industry.  More than a million persons visit the province each year, with almost
one quarter of these coming from outside Canada.<p>

These messages appear to be caused by .tmp files created by an earlier
FrameMaker
session, left in the \windows directory.  They begin with "F", and end with
".TMP".
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Selecting "Cancel" on each file sharing violation dialog appears to be
a workaround, although it is a bit annoying. Removing the offending ".tmp"
files from your \windows directory, before starting FrameMaker, will
solve the problem permanently.

<title>
COULD NOT LOCATE VROBJ.DLL (OS/2 WARP BONUSPAK)
</title>
<h3>
COULD NOT LOCATE VROBJ.DLL (OS/2 WARP BONUSPAK)
</h3>
Last updated: 11 Feb 1995
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>

    Customer is attempting to run the BonusPak Installation
    Utility (INSTALL.CMD).  The program starts up and issues
    five "1 file(s) copied" messages and then pops up an error
    box that states: " BPIU.EXE - COULD NOT LOCATE VROBJ.DLL ".

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>

    Somehow the customer's LIBPATH statement has been changed
    such that the ".;" (dot semicolon) has been deleted from
    the LIBPATH.  The LIBPATH statement in CONFIG.SYS should
    look similar to this: LIBPATH=.;C:\OS2\DLL;C:\OS2\MDOS;
    continuing on to the end.  NOTE: C is drive where OS/2
    Warp is installed.

</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>

    If your customer is experiencing this error with the
    BonusPak Installation Utility, have the customer check
    his CONFIG.SYS file and look for the .; in the LIBPATH
    statement.  It normally should be the first entry in
    the list of subdirectories.  On a newly installed machine
    it is the first item.  It may however be located anywhere
    on the LIBPATH= line.  Ask the customer if he might have
    edited this line in his CONFIG.SYS or installed any
    applications that stated that they were going to edit
    or update CONFIG.SYS.  That will be the way to determine
    how the line might have gotten modified.  OS/2 Warp needs
    the .; in the LIBPATH to function correctly.

    A missing .; in the LIBPATH can result in all sorts of
    errors occurring with different programs of the BonusPak
    and the system in general.

<title>Fact Sheet:  Prince Edward Island</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->
</head>
<body>

<center>
<img align=bottom src="peimap.gif">
<h1>Prince Edward Island</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<p>
One of the four Atlantic Provinces, Prince Edward Island is also Canada's smallest
province in both area and population.
<P>
The crescent-shaped island is 224 km in length and ranges in width from 6 to 64
km,  giving it a total area of 5 660 km<em sup>2</em>.  It lies in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, separated from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick by Northumberland
Strait.  Its highest point is 152 m above sea level.  The province has numerous
lakes and rivers, most of which are quite small.
<P>
Rich soil and a temperate climate make Prince Edward Island an ideal place for
mixed farming.  Half of its land is under cultivation, earning it the nickname, "the
Garden Province."  It is renowned for its red soil, sand dunes and 800 km of
beaches.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
Prince Edward Island was called "Abegweit" by the Micmac Indians, who lived
there for some 2 000 years before the arrival of the Europeans.  The name means
"lying down flat," but is freely translated as "cradled by the waves." There is
evidence that the ancestors of the Micmacs lived on the island 10 000 years ago,
presumably having migrated across the low plain now covered by Northumberland
Strait.
<P>
The Europeans discovered the island when Jacques Cartier landed there in 1534;
he described it as "the most beautiful stretch of land imaginable." In spite of his
enthusiastic description, it was a long time before the island was settled.  No
permanent colony existed until the French established one in 1719; 30 years later,
the population numbered a mere 700.
<P>
The population of the island multiplied after the British deported the Acadians from
Nova Scotia in 1755.  By the time Louisbourg fell to the British in 1758, the
island's population had risen to 5 000.
<P>
In 1766 Captain Samuel Holland prepared a topographic map of the island, then
known as the Island of Saint John, dividing it onto 67 parcels of land and
distributing it by lot to a group of British landowners.  The absentee landlords,
many of whom never set foot on the island, gave rise to numerous problems. 
Some refused to sell their lands to their tenants, while others demanded exorbitant purchase or rental prices.
<P>
In 1769 the Island of Saint John became a separate colony, and in 1799 it was
given its present name, in honour of Prince Edward of England.
<P>
Prince Edward Island is known as the cradle of Confederation, since Charlottetown,
its capital, was the site of the 1864 conference that set Canadian Confederation in
motion.  This distinction notwithstanding, the island waited until 1873 to join the
Dominion of Canada.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<p>
The population of Prince Edward Island was 130 000 in 1991.  Of this
number, 62 percent live in the rural districts, including 8 percent on farms.  With a
population of 33 000, Charlottetown is the only urban centre.
<P>
Approximately 80 percent of the people are of British (mainly Scottish and Irish)
origin.  About 15 percent are of French origin, and five percent speak French.
<P>
The island population is quite young -- about 38 percent of the people are under
25.
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Agriculture, tourism and fishing are the economic mainstays of Prince Edward
Island.  Most of the industrial activity has to do with food processing, although
high-technology industry is becoming important, especially in the medical,
electronics and agricultural fields.
<P>
Prince Edward Island's rich, red soil is ideal for growing potatoes, which are the
most important source of income for the province's farms.
<P>
Although lobster is king of the waters off Prince Edward Island, about 30 other fish
and seafood species are caught, notably cultivated mussels, herring, bluefin tuna
and the renowned Malpeque oysters.
<P>
Finally, the island's 800 km of beaches attract over 665 000 visitors yearly for
relaxation and water sports, including bluefin tuna fishing.

<title>SLIP - Can't find SLIP.CFG</title>
<h2>SLIP - Can't find SLIP.CFG</h2>
Last Updated: 14th December, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When I start SLIP, it says I don't have a SLIP.CFG file.
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
N/A
<hr>
<h2>Problem</h2>
This symptom probably means you have installed the "Internet
Connection for OS/2 Software" but are trying to run
the SLIP.EXE without using either "IBM Internet Dialer" or
"Dial Other Internet Providers".
<hr>
<h2>Fix</h2>
<p>
First of all, determine if you really do NOT want to use
one of the provided dialers. The dialers really do a very
good job of establishing all the configuration required
to get SLIP (and all the IAK applications) running.
<p>
Assuming that you do not want to use one of
the provided dialers then
you need to make sure that the following
is in a file called slip.cfg in the directory pointed
to by the ETC environment variable.
<pre>
    interface sl0 
    { 
       device=com?, 
       mtu=296, 
       compression=off 
    }
</pre>
<p>
where com? is the serial port in use by the modem, and
compression is set according to whether you want 
to use SLIP or CSLIP.
<p>
SLIP should then start up ok. If you want to dial out
"manually", start SLIPTERM and type the modem dialler
commands. When connected, logon to the service
provider, start the slip connection then press F10 to
get out of SLIPTERM to let SLIP start running.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Notes</h2>
If you do decide to invoke SLIP manually you will
need to setup all the other configuration that
the dialers normally do. For example: the configuration
of the interface, name resolution and routing. This
is not really a job for those who do not have experience
with the full TCP/IP implementation. In other words, unless
you know what you are doing, use the dialers.
<p>
<strong>A tip:</strong> don't kill SLIP before exiting
SLIPTERM. Doing so will cause a system trap.

<h1>Quebec</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<P>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
Bordered by Ontario, New Brunswick and Labrador (the mainland portion of the
province of Newfoundland) and by the United States, Quebec has an area of 1 450
680 km<em sup>2</em>, three times that of France and seven times that of Great
Britain, making it the largest of Canada's provinces.  The province is almost entirely
surrounded by water: by Hudson Strait to the north, the St. Lawrence River and
Gulf to the south, and James Bay and Hudson Bay to the west.
<P>
From north to south, Quebec takes in three main geographical regions:  the
Canadian Shield, the St. Lawrence lowlands and the Appalachian Mountains. 
Extending from the shores of the Canadian Arctic to the Laurentians, the Canadian
Shield covers about 60 percent of the land mass, and is the world's oldest
mountain range.  Permafrost reigns in the northern part of the Shield; only dwarf
birches and lichen are able to grow there.
<P>
The St. Lawrence River, the province's dominant geographical feature, links the
Atlantic Ocean with the Great Lakes.  The St. Lawrence lowlands are dotted with
more than a million lakes and rivers.  Quebec's forests are equal in area to those of
Sweden and Norway combined.
<P>
To the south, the foothills of the Appalachians separate Quebec from the United
States.
<P>
Almost 80 percent of Quebeckers live in urban centres located along the St.
Lawrence.  Montreal and its suburbs have a population of three million; Quebec
City is the province's capital and third-largest city.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The name Quebec, which comes from an Algonkian word meaning "narrow
passage" or "strait," originally meant the narrowing down of the St. Lawrence
River off what is currently Quebec City.  Quebec was originally inhabited by
members of the Algonquin and Iroquois aboriginal people.  The northern part of the
province was, and still is, inhabited by the Inuit (previously known as
"Eskimos").<P>
<P>
The European history of Quebec began with the arrival of the French explorer
Jacques Cartier in 1534.  The succeeding era was characterized by the
establishment of a thriving fur trade, relatively friendly relations with the aboriginal
people and a continuous rivalry between French and English colonists.
<P>
Founded in 1608, Quebec City became the capital of New France.  During the
French regime, the fortified city was an important centre of trade and development.
 Today it is regarded as the cradle of French civilization in America, and was
named a World Heritage City by UNESCO in 1985.
<P>
French-English rivalry in North America culminated with the Seven Years' War,
which saw the fall of Quebec City to British forces in 1759.  With the Treaty of
Paris in 1763, New France became a colony of Britain.  In 1774, under the Quebec
Act, Britain granted official recognition to French civil laws, guaranteed religious
freedom and authorized the use of the French language. 
<P>
In 1791, the colony was divided in two to reflect the large influx of Loyalists who,
wishing to remain British subjects, fled north after the American Revolution, to
settle in western Quebec.  This led to the creation of Upper Canada (now Ontario)
and Lower Canada (Quebec).  After rebellions in both regions in 1837, the two
were reunited by the Act of Union, 1840 and became the Province of Canada.  In
1867, Quebec became a founding member of the new Dominion of Canada.
<P>
For a long time, Quebec's rural roots and domination by the Roman Catholic
Church made it a traditional, agrarian society.  With the advent of the second
industrial revolution between 1920 and 1940, urbanization and higher living
standards came to the province.
<P>
Beginning in 1960, Quebec entered a period of transition: the "Quiet Revolution". It
was marked by rapid economic expansion, cultural pride and a revamping of
political institutions to meet the needs of contemporary society.
<P>
The Quiet Revolution was also the beginning of a period of political tension and
federal-provincial bickering as the province sought to assume greater control over
its economy and society.  Regrettably, acts of terrorism, including political
kidnapping in 1970, brought in sharp relief the issue of Quebec's status in Canada.
<P>
In 1976, Quebeckers elected the Parti qu&eacute;b&eacute;cois, a party wanting
independance for Quebec.  The PQ made French the sole, official language of
Quebec, and, in 1980, conducted a referendum on negotiating an arrangement for
sovereignty-association with Canada.  The referendum was defeated by a majority
of Quebec citizens.
<P>
Throughout Quebec's history, the survival of the "French fact" in Quebec and also
in the rest of Canada has been central to the concerns of Quebeckers.  It is this
very aspect that reflects Quebec's distinct place in the Canadian Confederation and
gives Canada its bilingual character and cultural richness.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
Out of a total population of about seven million, Quebec has more than five million
people of French origin, 350 000 of British origin and about 137 000 Amerindians
(Mohawk, Cree, Montagnais, Algonquin, Attikamek, Micmac, Huron, Abenaki and
Naskapi), M&eacute;tis and Inuit.<P>

Italians and Eastern Europeans were traditionally the largest immigrant groups to
Quebec, but since 1960 the ranks of new Quebeckers have been swollen by
Portuguese, Haitians, Lebanese, South Americans and Southeast Asians.  Since the
end of World War II, more than 650 000 immigrants from over 80 countries have
moved to Quebec, particularly to the city of Montreal.
<P>
French is the mother tongue of 82.2 percent of Quebeckers, while 9.7 percent cite
English as their mother tongue.
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Highly industrialized and quite diversified, Quebec's economy is strong and full of
promise.  The province has abundant natural resources and energy, along with
well-developed agriculture, manufacturing and service sectors.  Quebec's dynamic
business sector has seized on the economic potential of the province, and produces
a wide variety of top quality products for export, such as air traffic control
equipment, software, subway trains, helicopters, compact disks, air purifiers and
toys.
<P>
Montreal, the province's commercial capital, has developed competitive industries
in space and aeronautics, telecommunications, energy and transportation.
<P>
Quebec exports 40 percent of its total production, mainly from the forest industry
(printing, lumber and paper), mining (aluminium and iron ore) and transportation
equipment manufacturing.  Quebec also exports electricity, engineering know-how,
electronic products and telecommunications equipment.

<h1>Ontario</h1>
<hr>
</center>

<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
The name "Ontario" comes from the Iroquois word "Kanadario" meaning "sparkling
water."  The name is fitting: not only is Ontario bordered on the south by the Great
Lakes and on the north by Hudson Bay, but 177 390 km<em sup>2</em>, or one
sixth of its terrain, is covered by rivers and lakes.
<P>
Three main geological regions make up Ontario:  the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence
Lowlands, the Canadian Shield and the Hudson Bay Lowlands.  The latter are
narrow coastal plains bordering Hudson Bay and James Bay; the land is wet and
covered by scrub growth.  The Canadian Shield, covering the rest of northern
Ontario from Lake Superior to Hudson Bay, and extending into the southern part of
the province, is a vast rocky plateau.  Although the soil is poor and not well suited
to large-scale farming, there is a wealth of minerals, forests and water power.
<P>
The Canadian Shield and the Hudson Bay Lowlands cover 90 percent of the
province's 1 068 580 km<em sup>2</em> of territory, but are home to only 10
percent of the population.  Northern Ontario's towns were built because of the
railway, and today rails and roads carry the products of the mines and mills
southward.  Further north, travel is often limited to air and water.  The extremes of
the northern climate are a fact of life there.  At Winisk, mean daily temperatures
reach only 12 to 15<em sup>o</em>C in July, dropping to -25<em sup>o</em>C in
January.
<P>
The five Great Lakes are the most visible results of the ice age in Ontario, and the
biggest, Lake Superior, is the world's largest body of fresh water.
<P>
The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Lowlands comprise the rest of southern Ontario and
contain most of the population, industry, commerce and agricultural lands.  The
Lowlands include the Windsor-Thousand Islands-St. Lawrence Valley triangle.  The
relatively temperate climate is more severe east of the Great Lakes.  Mean annual
summer temperatures reach 22<em sup>o</em>C in the south, where the temperate
climate and fertile soils nurture a major agricultural industry.  This relatively small
area has more than half of Canada's best agricultural land.  
<P>
Toronto, Ontario's capital and Canada's largest city, with a regional population
approaching four million, is Canada's leading producer of manufactured goods and
headquarters of a large number of Canadian companies.  Ottawa, the bilingual,
bicultural national capital, sits at the junction of the Gatineau, Rideau and Ottawa
rivers.
<p>
<h3>The History</h3><P>
<P>
Ontario's first immigrants arrived about 10 000 years ago, during the last ice age. 
The European explorers encountered the Iroquois and Algonquin descendants of
those first migrants in the 17th century.  Sailing into the large bay that bears his
name, Henry Hudson became the first European to touch the shores of present-day
Ontario in 1610; in 1613, Samuel de Champlain and &Eacute;tienne
Br&ucirc;l&eacute; made the first contacts with the aboriginal people in the
southern part of the province.
<P>
In 1774 the British ruled over southern Ontario, then part of the British colony of
Quebec.  Under the Constitutional Act of 1791, "Quebec" was divided in two and
Ontario renamed Upper Canada.  This became necessary with the tremendous
influx of Loyalist refugees after the American Revolution.
<P>
In 1840, the Act of Union saw Upper and Lower Canada reunited, this time with
the name Canada.  The two regions, Canada West and Canada East, took part in
the 1864 Confederation debate and, when the Dominion of Canada was created in
1867, became the separate provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
From 1779 on, waves of English, Scottish and Irish immigrants followed one
another, moving up the St. Lawrence and populating the country.  Today,
immigration continues to be important to Ontario, and there are large numbers of
people of Italian, German, Chinese, Dutch, Portuguese, Indian and Polish origin. 

<P>
In 1991, Ontario had almost 250,000 people of Indian, M&eacute;tis or Inuit
origin.
<P>
With over 10 million people, Ontario is the country's most heavily populated
province.  English is the only official language, but Ontario's Francophones play an
essential part in the province's cultural life and are the largest language minority. 
The provincial government provides services in French in the regions where the
Francophone population is sufficiently high.
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Ontario is Canada's most productive province, having generated some 40 percent
of the country's gross domestic product in 1992.  Its manufacturing industries lead
the way ($85 billion in 1992).  Ontario's competitive advantages include its natural
resources, modern transportation system, large, well-educated labour force, reliable
and relatively inexpensive electrical power, and proximity to key U.S. markets: less
than a day's drive puts Ontario's products within reach of 120 million American
consumers.
<P>
In Canada's urban and industrial heartland the car is king.  Automobiles are
Ontario's major manufacturing industry and most important export, employing 136
 000 people and providing 26 percent of Canada's total exports in 1989.
<P>
Mining has always played an important role in the development of Ontario's
economy.  Extraction of gold, nickel, copper, uranium and zinc represents a
multibillion-dollar business.
<P>
Many Ontario towns have at least one industry connected to forestry.  Fully 87
percent of the forest land is owned by the provincial government, which licenses
logging rights.  The forest industry accounts for 5.8 percent of Ontario's
exports.
<P>
Financial industries are also a source of prosperity.  Toronto is the world's fourth-
largest capital market; its stock exchange is North America's second-largest by
volume and third-largest by value traded.
<P>
Tourism is also important to the Ontario economy.  In 1990, tourist spending of
more than $9.5 billion generated about $13.4 billion in total revenue for the
province and more than 320 000 person-years of employment.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Running attached to a 3rd party Internet access provider while
simultaneously running TCP/IP locally on a LAN.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Any 
<h2>Problem</h2>
INET.SYS provides routing capabilities by default.  This is a potential
security issue which could allow unauthorized access to an otherwise
secure network.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
At the command line type "IPGATE OFF".  This command should be put in the
startup.cmd file to ensure it is in effect  whenever the two TCP/IP
networks are both up and running. IPGATE.EXE is provided in the IAK.
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
The suggested way of handling IP addressing and name resolution when 
simultaneously accessing TCP/IP via the LAN and IAK is to use IP addresses
for LAN access and names for IAK access.  However, you may be able to keep
multiple etc directories--the default for the IAK and another for LAN
access, the resolv file in the second etc would point to your local DNS
servers.   Start the apps doing local access by using .cmd files which
change the default ETC environmental value. Note: The IAK will save and 
restore a resolve file when the use the IAK dialer to connect and disconnect
from the Internet.
<p>
If security is not an issue, other machines on your LAN can access the
Internet through an OS/2 machine that is running the IAK and LAN TCP/IP
by defining that OS/2 box as a router in their local setup.
<p>
Thanks to IBM's John McGarvey and the OS2BBS for the information on 
IPGATE.

<h1>Manitoba</h1>
<hr>
</center>

<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
Bordered by Ontario, Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories, Hudson Bay and
the United States, Manitoba is one of the three Prairie provinces and is located in
the centre of Canada.
<P>
Its 650 000 <em sup></em>km<em sup>2</em> of landscape offers few extremes. 
Elevations rise slowly to the south and west from sea level at Hudson Bay.  Most
of Manitoba lies between 150 and 300 m above sea level, but in the Turtle, Riding,
Duck and Baldy mountains, heights rise to 700 m or higher.  The highest point in
Manitoba is Baldy Mountain, in Duck Mountain Provincial Park, at 831 m.
<P>
Manitoba is known as the land of 100 000 lakes, a legacy of enormous Lake
Agassiz which covered much of the province after the glaciers retreated.  The
major rivers of western Canada flow into the lowland region of Manitoba, giving
Manitoba 90 percent of the hydro-electric potential of the Prairie region.  The
northern topography is heavily glaciated and covered in forest, dominated by pine,
hemlock and birch.
<P>
Manitoba is one of the sunniest provinces in Canada.  It has a continental climate,
with great temperatures extremes.  Typical of southern Manitoba, the mean
January temperature in Winnipeg is about -20&#186;C; the July average is about
19&#186;C.  In Thompson, in the centre of northern Manitoba, the averages for
the same months are about -27&#186;C and 15&#186;C.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The name Manitoba likely comes from the Cree words "Manitou bou", which mean
"the narrows of the Great Spirit."  The words applied to Lake Manitoba, which
narrows to less than a kilometre at its centre.  The waves hitting the loose surface
rocks of its north shore produce curious bell-like and wailing sounds, which the
first aboriginal peoples believed came from a huge drum beaten by the spirit
Manitou.
<P>
The Assiniboine Indians were the first inhabitants of Manitoba.  Other tribes
included the nomadic Cree, who followed the herds of bison and caribou on their
seasonal migrations.
<P>
In their search for the rich Orient through the Northwest Passage, Europeans
reached Manitoba through Hudson Bay.  Unlike most of the rest of Canada, the
northern parts of the province were settled before the south.  In 1612, Captain
Thomas Button wintered two ships at the mouth of the Nelson River, on Hudson
Bay.  Later, a party led by La V&eacute;rendrye explored the Red and Winnipeg
rivers in the years 1733-38 and built several outposts.
<P>
Early European interest in Manitoba centred on the fur trade.  In 1670, the
Hudson's Bay Company was created, and King Charles II of England granted it a
large tract of land named Rupert's Land. The company set up fur-trading posts to
exploit the country's wealth.  During the 18th century, intense rivalry for fur trade
supremacy developed between the Montreal-based North West Company and the
Hudson's Bay Company.
<P>
In 1812, the first European agricultural settlement was established in the area
around the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers by Lord Selkirk, a Scottish
nobleman, who sent a number of Scottish Highlanders to settle land he had
secured from the Hudson's Bay Company.  He called the area Assiniboia.  The
Selkirk colony suffered through floods and problems arising from unfamiliarity with
the environment, and rivalries within the fur trade.  Nevertheless, the settlement
survived.
<P>
In 1836, Assiniboia was transferred to the Hudson's Bay Company by the Selkirk
family.  In the 1860s, the provinces of Canada, anxious to expand into the great
northwest, offered to buy the land from the Hudson's Bay Company.  Negotiations
for the transfer of sovereignty of the Hudson's Bay Company lands to Canada
followed, but with little regards to the wishes of the inhabitants.
<P>
During the lenghty negotiations, this lack of consultation and the movement of
American and Canadian settlers into the territory led the M&eacute;tis (people of
mixed aboriginal and European blood) to fear for the
preservation of their land rights and culture.  The M&eacute;tis, under the leadership of
Louis Riel, opposed the Canadian proposals in an insurgency known as the Red
River Rebellion.  Riel succeeded in establishing a locally-elected, provisional
government in December 1869.  Delegates of this provisional government
negotiated terms with the new federal government of Canada, making Manitoba a
province of the Dominion of Canada on July 15, 1870.
<P>
The new "postage stamp" province (so named because of its square shape and
small size) consisted then of 36 000 km<em sup>2</em> surrounding the Red River
Valley.  However, the province did not remain that small; its boundaries were
stretched in 1881 and again in 1912.  
<P>
Bolstered by its central location as the entry point to western Canada, Manitoba
grew quickly over the next 50 years.  With the help of the railway, thousands of
settlers from eastern Canada and from countries all over the world made Manitoba
their home.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
For many years, most Manitobans were of British origin.  But changes in migration
 and immigration patterns have produced a province where no ethnic group is
numerically dominant.  Manitoba is home to dozens of groups from all over the
world, who have enriched the province's economy, culture and society.
<P>
Although Manitoba is one of the smaller provinces in population, it is an important
centre for a number of ethnic groups.  It is one of the most important centres of
Ukrainian culture outside Ukraine and has one of the largest populations of
Mennonites in the world.  More than 115 000 people are of Amerindian
or M&eacute;tis origin.
<P>
About 60 percent of Manitoba's 1 091 949 people live in metropolitan Winnipeg,
the provincial capital.  The second-largest city is Brandon, in southwestern
Manitoba.
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
The early provincial economy was based on agriculture, with manufacturing and
transportation later becoming vital sectors.   Manitoba now has a very diversified
economy, but the services sector is the most important.  The central location of the
province makes Manitoba an attractive base for a wide variety of services, notably
in transportation and wholesale distribution.
<P>
Manufacturing is the largest goods-producing economic sector.  Food and
transportation equipment have long been the leading manufacturing industries. 
Other important industries are primary and fabricated metals, electrical goods,
clothing and textiles, and printing and publishing.
<P>
Agriculture is the backbone of rural Manitoba, as well as supporting thousands of
jobs in towns and cities.  The strong balance in the Manitoba economy is reflected
in agriculture, where both crops and livestock are important sectors.  Wheat is the
most important crop, accounting for about a third of crop production value,
followed by barley and canola.  The province is the leading Canadian producer of
flaxseed, sunflower seeds, buckwheat and field peas.
<P>
Mining is another major Manitoba industry, with metals normally accounting for
three quarters of the value of production.  The most important metals are nickel,
(of which the province is a world leader in production), copper and zinc.  Manitoba
also produces petroleum and a number of industrial minerals.
<P>
Camping grounds, parks, lakes and rivers as well as historic sites are the principal
attractions for Manitoba's visitors.  Tourism also relies on dozens of community
festivals, a number of which have international reputations.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When Using Web Explorer with an ftp URL .exe files do not get transferred as
binary
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Any environment supporting Web Explorer.
<h2>Problem</h2>
..exe is not a valid mime (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (RFC 1521))
extension and
may not be treated as you expect by Web Explorer.  You may wish to have this
file
transferred in the same way that .zip files are transferred and saved
locally.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Edit your EXPLORE.INI file
<p>
find the line with this:
<pre>
extmap=
</pre>
<p>
modify it to look like this:
<pre>
extmap=d:\tcpip\etc\extmap.txt (place your drive instead of d:)
</pre>
<p>
Then make a file called extmap.txt in that particular directory and put this
in there:
<pre>
application/octet-stream   exe bin mid arj lha lhz
text/plain                 txt ini package
</pre>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
If you want other binary files to be transferred as binary files and saved
to disk,
you may add the extension to the first line.  More text file extensions can
be added
to the second line.  Adding too many extensions to a line
can cause problems.  You can put in additional lines.  E.g. for binary
transfers:
<pre>
application/octet-stream  exe bin mid arj lha lhz
disk-image/octet-steam    dsk 1dk 2dk 3dk 4dk 5dk 6dk 7dk 8dk 9dk 0dk
text/plain                txt ini package doc 1st cmd bat rsp
</pre>
<p>
The above procedure belongs to Adrian (idzik@info.polymtl.ca) who posted the
procedure
on comp.os.os2.networking.tcpip newsgroup in February.  Thanks Adrian.

<h1>Saskatchewan</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
Located in the western part of Canada, Saskatchewan is bordered by Manitoba,
Alberta, the Northwest Territories and the United States.  The province is almost
rectangular in shape and is 651 900 km<em sup>2</em> in area.  Half of it consists
of forests, one third of cultivated lands, and one eighth is covered with
water.
<P>
The northern zone rests on a formation of Precambrian rock characteristic of the
Canadian Shield.  As a result, there are numerous lakes (over 100 000), rivers,
bogs and rocky outcroppings.
<P>
The southern part of the province is relatively flat, with occasional valleys created
by erosion from the glacial era.  This prairie zone is where most of the people
live.
<P>
Camel caravans would not be out of place in certain parts of Saskatchewan. 
Athabasca Provincial Park has sand dunes 30 m high and semi-arid vegetation. 
Nowhere else in the world are dunes found this far north.
<P>
The name Saskatchewan comes from the Cree word "kisiskatchewanisipi," which
means "swift-flowing river."  The province has three major rivers:  the Assiniboine,
the South Saskatchewan and the Churchill. 
<P>
The whole province enjoys a hot, dry summer but the town of Estevan is the
undisputed "sunshine capital" of Canada, getting 2540 hours of sunshine per
year.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The first European explorers and trappers to visit Saskatchewan found established
settlements of Aboriginal people.  The Chipewyan Indians lived in the north; the
nomadic Blackfoot roamed the eastern plains, while the Assiniboine inhabited the
west.  The territory of the Cree, who were long-time residents of the north, also
extended southward to the plains.
<P>
The earliest explorer was Henry Kelsey, a Hudson Bay's Company agent, who in
about 1690 followed the Saskatchewan River to the southern plains of
Saskatchewan.  On the heels of the trappers came fur-trading companies and
trading posts, which became the foundation of many present-day settlements.
<P>
For 200 years, the Hudson's Bay Company owned and administered the vast
Northwest Territories.  Realizing their agricultural potential and the opportunities for
colonization, the Government of Canada purchased the Territories in 1870.  After
the Dominion Lands Act of 1872, which encouraged homesteaders, and another
act to stimulate immigration, the new railway began bringing settlers in to farm
 these rich lands.
<P>
When Saskatchewan separated from the Northwest Territories and entered
Confederation in 1905, Regina became the provincial capital.  The years following
were years of prosperity, until the 1929 economic crash, combined with a decade
of drought and bad harvests, brought the lean years of the Great Depression to the
province.
<P>
In 1945, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) became the first
socialist government elected in North America.  Its leader, Tommy Douglas, led the
fight for public hospitalization and medicare, earning Saskatchewan the reputation
as the "social laboratory of North America."
<P>
The recovery of the 1940s and 1950s saw the economy, once dependent solely on
agriculture, become more diversified with the development of oil, uranium, potash,
coal and other minerals.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
The M&eacute;tis, people of mixed European and Aboriginal descent, were among
the first settlers, many of them having migrated from Manitoba.  With land
available at token prices, agriculture gradually replaced the fur trade.  A major
wave of immigration began in 1899 and continued until 1929.
<P>
Today, Saskatchewan's population stands at about one million.  Saskatchewan is
Canada's only province where the majority of the population does not have a
British or French background.  The population has a variety of ethnic inheritances --
German, Ukrainian, Scandinavian, Amerindian, Dutch, Polish and Russian -- as well
as British, French, and many other non-European origins.
<P>
Regina and Saskatoon are the two main cities and together have about one third of
the total population.  Named after Queen Victoria (Victoria Regina), the capital is
the site of Wascana Centre, one of the world's largest urban parks.  Saskatoon,
which has a larger population, is bisected by the South Saskatchewan River.
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Saskatchewan has changed greatly since it joined Confederation in 1905.  Back
then, agriculture was the only industry, and it centred on wheat farming.  Today,
Saskatchewan supplies 28 percent of Canada's grain production, and crops include
canola, rye, oats, barley and flaxseeds, as well as wheat.  Saskatchewan is also a
major producer of cattle and hogs.  The average Saskatchewan farm takes up 420
hectares.
<P>
Northern Saskatchewan's 350 000 km<em sup>2</em> of forests are the province's
most important renewable natural resource.  Softwoods are the focal point of
forestry development.
<P>
Saskatchewan is also a province rich in minerals.  Potash, uranium, coal, oil and
natural gas are the leading mineral resources.  Saskatchewan's 14 000 oil wells
produce about 12 percent of Canada's total oil output.  In addition, with an
estimated two thirds of the world's reserves, Saskatchewan is the leading exporter
of potash. 
<P>
Research and development is a growing business in Saskatchewan, as attested to
by the inauguration of Saskatoon's Innovation Centre.  The province's
technological potential in agriculture, space technology and biotechnology is now
recognized internationally.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
The latest slip/ppp update broke the redial loop in my REXX script
used to "Dial Other Internet Provider."
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Various
<h2>Problem</h2>
The version of slippm.exe distributed with the
ppp "golden" code in May 1995 is hard coded to abort when a
busy signal is received.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
This breaks the redial loop in REXX dialing scripts.  I have fashioned a
successful workaround by patching slippm.exe with a binary editor.  I would be
glad to post the patched version for ftp if it were not copyrighted IBM code.
It is easy to make the modification yourself, however, using the following
instructions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Make a backup of slippm.exe
<p>
<pre>
COPY SLIPPM.EXE SLIPPM.XEX
</pre>
<LI> Use a hex editor to edit slippm.exe
<p>
Use an OS/2 PM based binary editor such as
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/.4/os2/editors/hexedit2.zip">HexEdit/2</a>
, or boot to DOS
and use your favourite DOS binary editor (Norton, PCTools, etc.)
<p>
<LI> Search for the string "BUSY" (no quotes)
<p>
<LI> Change this string to some other 4 character string
<p>
Choose a string that is not likely to appear in a dialing sequence. I used ETOH. ;-)
<p>
<LI> Write the patched file out to disk.
</OL>

Just saw the above update to the Warp Pharmacy about the gold PPP and 
how it cancels REXX scripts on BUSY.  Actually it cancels and starts 
timers depending on what it sees from the modem, fortunately 
we can control what is seen.  The following code fragments show how 
to modify a script to handle the new code.  I have passed this 
method along to the author of PPPDIAL and versions after 2.3 should 
incorporate it.
<p>
<pre>
/* when you are initializing your variables set */

t2u = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
t2l = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

/* where you reconize the final connect */

if abbrev( ResultCode, 'CONNECT' ) then do

    call lineout, 'CONNECT Your message goes here'

end

/* where you echo the modem's output to the dialer */

call charout , translate(substr(waitfor_buffer, curpos), t2l, t2u)

<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
The westernmost of Canada's three Prairie provinces, Alberta lies between the
49th and 60th parallels, at virtually the same latitude as the United Kingdom. 
Alberta is 1217 km from north to south and between 293 and 650 km in width
from west to east.  Nearly equal in size to the state of Texas, the province covers
an area of some 661 185 km<em sup>2</em>.
<P>
Roughly half of the southwestern section of the province is dominated by
mountains and foothills -- striking reminders of the glaciers that, over millions of
years, formed, moved and receded in the area.  Peaks of the Rocky Mountains
located in Alberta range from 2130 to 3747 m in elevation.
<P>
The foothills, which form a gentle link between mountain and prairie landscapes,
feature heavily forested areas and grasslands used for grazing cattle.  Beneath their
surface, the foothills contain some of the province's richest deposits of sour gas
and coal.
<P>
The remainder of the province -- approximately 90 percent of the land area -- forms
part of the interior plain of North America.  The plains include the forested areas
that dominate the northern part of the province and the vast stretches of northern
muskeg that overlay much of Alberta's oil and gas deposits and oil sands.
<P>
Alberta has what is known as a continental climate.  It is characterized by vivid
seasonal contrasts in which long, cold winters are balanced by mild to hot
summers and an unusually high number of sunny days, no matter what the season. 
Although cold air covers the whole province in winter, it is frequently replaced in
the southwest by a mild wind, the "chinook", funnelling through the mountains
from the Pacific Ocean.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The native people, whose ancestors are thought to have crossed the Bering Sea
from Asia thousands of years ago, were the first people to live in what is now
Alberta. The Blackfoot, Blood, Piegan, Cree, Gros Ventre, Sarcee, Kootenay,
Beaver and Slavey Indians, speaking a variety of Athapaskan and Algonkian
languages, were the sole inhabitants of what was then a vast wilderness
territory.
<P>
The early Albertans, particularly the woodland tribes of the central and northern
regions, became valuable partners of the European fur traders who arrived in the
18th century.  The first European explorer to reach what is now Alberta was
Anthony Henday, in 1754.  <p>

Peter Pond, of the North West Company, established the first fur-trading post in
the area in 1778.  The Hudson's Bay Company gradually extended its control
throughout a huge expanse of northern North America known as Rupert's Land and
the North West Territory, including the region occupied by present-day Alberta.
From that time, the region was fought over by the Hudson's Bay Company and the
North West Company, each of which built competing fur-trading posts. The rivalry
ended only in 1821, when the two companies merged.
<P>
Expeditions led by Henry Youle Hind and John Palliser found parts of the region to
have exceptionally good land for farming, especially the fertile belt north of the
Palliser Triangle, a particularly arid zone.  As a result of these findings, the British
decided not to renew the licence of the Hudson's Bay Company and, in 1870, the
North West Territory was acquired by the Dominion of Canada and administered
from the newly formed province of Manitoba.
<P>
Beginning with the arrival of the railway in 1883, the population started to grow
quickly. Other factors that helped swell the population were the discovery of new
strains of wheat particularly suited to the climate of the Canadian Prairies, the lack
of new farmland in the United States, and the end of an economic depression
throughout North America.
<P>
On September 1, 1905, Alberta, named for Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, fourth
daughter of Britain's Queen Victoria, became a province of Canada with Edmonton
as its capital city.  The province of Alberta was created by joining the District of
Alberta with parts of the districts of Athabasca, Assiniboia and Saskatchewan. 
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
Tracing the roots of Alberta's 2.5 million people is an exercise that begins with the
province's Aboriginals and leads to virtually every corner of the globe.  The
province's native people formed the bulk of the area's population until the 1880s,
when they were outnumbered by the influx of Europeans.  In 1881, there were
barely more than 1000 non-native people in the area that was to become the
province of Alberta.  Ten years later, 17 500 people occupied the territory.
Immigrants from many countries came in response to the Canadian government's
aggressive efforts, between the 1890s and the 1920s, to promote immigration and
encourage agricultural development.  By the end of the immigration push in 1921,
there were 584 454 Albertans.  
<P>
After the Second World War, the pattern changed.  From the 1960s on, immigrants
have come from all over the world, including the Pacific Rim, Asia and the
Caribbean.  Today, roughly 44 percent of Albertans are of British descent; other
large ethnic groups are the German, Ukrainian, French, Scandinavian and Dutch. In
1991, close to 150 000 people were of Indigenous or M&eacute;tis origin.  Smaller
numbers of people, tracing their heritage to virtually every country in the world,
make up the remaining 24 percent of the population.  English is the language of the
 vast majority of Albertans, and most religious faiths are represented.
<P>
With two thirds of the population under the age of 40, the province has one of the
youngest populations in the industrialized world.  This is, in part, due to the high
level of international and interprovincial migration to Alberta over the past 25
years.  Approximately 80 percent of Albertans live in urban areas, and more than
half live in the two main cities of Edmonton, the province's capital, and
Calgary.
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Alberta has one of the world's most productive agricultural economies, producing
about 20 percent of the value of Canada's annual output.  Approximately 22
million hectares of cultivated and uncultivated land are used as pasture and forage
for livestock.  While wheat remains the primary crop, the production of new crops
continues to expand as the industry diversifies.  The province maintains the largest
livestock population in Canada.
<P>
Long known as Canada's "energy province," Alberta has more than 80 percent of
the country's reserves of conventional crude oil, over 90 percent of its natural gas,
and all of its bitumen and oil-sands reserves.  The oil and natural gas sector has
responded successfully to the challenges of unstable energy prices in the 1980s by
significantly reducing production and operating costs.
<P>
Over one half of the province of Alberta, or approximately 350 000 km<em
sup>2</em>, is covered by forests.  Of the total forest area, 216 000 km<em
sup>2</em> are classified as commercially productive forest land and contain both
hardwood and softwood species.  Alberta's sustainable development policy
regarding the use of forest and other renewable resources is that the land, water,
vegetation and wildlife are managed as one ecosystem.  The use of these
resources is strictly on a sustainable basis.
<P>
Food and beverage processing remains the largest manufacturing industry in
Alberta in terms of both sales and employment.  Petrochemicals and plastics, forest
products, metals and machinery, and refineries have become major success stories
in contributing to Alberta's diversification efforts over the last several years.  An
increasing range of industrial products -- including aerospace and transportation
equipment, as well as industrial and specialty chemicals -- is also being
manufactured in Alberta.
<P>
The service sector accounts for more than 60 per cent of Alberta's gross domestic
product.  More than two thirds of Alberta's employment is found in such industries
as business and financial services, transportation, retail trade, health and education
services, and tourism.  The province offers a multitude of attractions to visitors,
and particularly prides itself on the magnificent Rocky Mountains, especially the
celebrated Jasper and Banff national parks.

<title>OS2.INI, HPFS and PTI DC4030VL-2 IDE Caching Controller Card</title>
<h2>OS2.INI, HPFS and PTI DC4030VL-2 IDE Caching Controller Card</h2>
Last Updated: January 14, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
        Workplace Shell is corrupted or does not come up upon booting OS/2.
OS2.INI and OS2SYS.ini files become corrupted.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
<pre>
   Promise Technologies, Inc. DC4030VL-2 IDE caching controller card
</pre>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
        The above mentioned caching controller card, when used in conjunction
with the Promise Technologies PTI1S506.ADD device driver and OS/2 installed on a
HPFS partition, will not correctly write the OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI files to the
\OS2 subdirectory.  The following procedure assumes that your system consists of
both FAT and HPFS partitions.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
A solution to this is to copy your OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI files to a
subdirectory on a FAT partition. Then in your CONFIG.SYS file for OS/2, edit the
following lines to correctly reference the files in their new position, i.e.
</p>
<p>
Using a FAT partition D: and the files placed in \OS2 subdirectory ....
</p>
<pre>

     SET USER_INI=D:\OS2\OS2.INI
     SET SYSTEM_INI=D:\OS2\OS2SYS.INI
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
The above procedure assumes that you're using the newest Promise Technologies
device driver, version 1.41, dated 12-12-94.  It is obtainable by calling the
Promise Technologies, Inc. BBS at 1-408-452-1267 or by downloading the driver
from various FTP sites (hobbes.cdrom.com and hobbes.nmsu.edu come to mind!).
</p>
<p>
For our controller BIOS setup, we have the Cache Mode set to ...
</p>
<pre>
    Turbo[Cache Enabled/Deferred Write]
</pre><p>
and Disk I/O Handler set to ...
</p><p><pre>
   Turbo[DC4030VL-2 BIOS Remapped]
</pre><p>
Remember to reset any ROM shadowing within the motherboard CMOS setup to account
for the shadowing of the DC4030VL-2 BIOS.
</p><p>
We have been very pleased with the performance of this controller card
within Warp, once the kinks were all worked out!

<title>Fact Sheet:  British Columbia</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->
</head>
<body>
<center>
<img align=bottom src="bcmap.gif">
<p>
<h1>British Columbia</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
British Columbia is Canada's westernmost province and one of North America's
most mountainous regions.  B.C. is bordered by the province of Alberta, the Yukon
Territory and several U.S. states, including Alaska.  Given its location, British
Columbia is a gateway to the Pacific and Asia.  Sometimes simply categorized as
part of Canada's "West", the province is actually a distinct region both
geographically and culturally.
<P>
The variety of its landscapes is the main reason for B.C.'s distinctiveness: its 947
800 km<em sup>2</em> offer remarkable topographical contrasts.  Where the
Pacific Ocean reaches the continent, it encounters with a chain of islands, large
and small, running from north to south.  Some of these islands are nestled in fiords
carved in the majestic Coastal Mountains, which rise more than 2000 m above sea
level.  
<P>
To the east of the Coastal Mountains lies a rolling upland of forests, natural
grasslands and lakes.  Further east, the Rocky Mountains (with peaks more than
4000 m high) separate B.C. from neighbouring Alberta.  In the north, a small corner
of the province is occupied by the Great Plains.
<P>
The province's climate equals its topography for variety.  For example, the mild
coastal region receives abundant precipitation -- from 130 to 380 cm of rain a year
-- while the interior has a continental climate.  Other parts of the province are
almost desert-like, with very hot summers followed by very cold winters.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The Aboriginal peoples of British Columbia developed one of the richest and most
complex cultures north of Mexico.  Because of the diversity of the Pacific coast --
mild to cold climate, seashore to mountains -- the tribes that settled in this area
developed completely different cultures and languages.  
<P>
The coastal inhabitants were experts at wood sculpture, as their totem polls attest
even today.  They were also famous for their skill and courage in whaling.  As for 
their social system, it was marked by occasions such as the <I>potlatch</I>  --
a ceremony in which important gifts were given to guests -- and by theatrical
displays.
<P>
In 1774 the first Europeans, under the flag of Spain, visited what is now British
Columbia.  In contrast with eastern Canada, where the English and French were
the two nationalities fighting over territory, Spain and Russia were the first
countries to claim ownership of certain parts of British Columbia.  In the 18th
century, the Spanish claimed the west coast from Mexico to Vancouver Island.  At
 the same time, the Russians were making an overlapping claim for control of the
Pacific coast from Alaska to San Francisco.
<P>
In 1778, Captain James Cook of Great Britain became the first person to chart the
region.  The first permanent colony, in present-day Victoria, was established by the
British in 1843.
<P>
When gold was discovered in the lower Fraser Valley in 1857, thousands of people
came in search of instant wealth.  To help maintain law and order, the British
government established the colony of British Columbia the following year.  In
1866, when the frenzy of the gold rush was over, the colony of Vancouver Island
joined British Columbia.
<P>
The colony was cut off from the rest of British North America by thousands of
kilometres and a mountain range.  The promise of a rail link between the Pacific
coast and the rest of Canada convinced British Columbia to join Confederation in
1871.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
The majority of B.C.'s inhabitants are of British origin, but the population is
enriched by immigrants and descendants of immigrants of all nationalities.  More
than 100 000 British Columbians are descendants of the thousands of Chinese
who took part in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the late 19th
century.  The Japanese began to arrive in the 1890s, becoming merchants and
fishermen.  Today, Vancouver has North America's second-largest Chinese
community.  More than 60 000 of B.C. inhabitants are from India, and 16 000 are
from Japan.  British Columbians of Asian heritage have contributed tremendously
to the province's economic and cultural vitality.
<P>
The Aboriginal population of British Columbia, which began to decline with the
arrival of the first European settlers, is enjoying new strength.  It is growing in
numbers (more than 165 000 people in 1991) and has developed strong native
organizations.  This new energy coincides with a renaissance in Aboriginal cultural
and artistic expression.
<P>
British Columbia continues to attract Canadians and foreigners alike: 40 000
persons settle in the province each year, and its population now exceeds 3.3
million -- 12 percent of Canada's total.  Nearly 60 percent live in the Victoria
(capital of the province) and Vancouver areas.  Vancouver, the largest dry cargo
port on the Pacific Coast of North America, is home to more than 1.5 million
people, which makes it the third-largest Canadian city.
<p>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
The economy is based on the province's great natural resources, primarily its vast
forests, which cover 56 percent of its total area.  Conifers from these forests are
converted into lumber, newsprint, pulp and paper products, shingles and shakes --
about half the total softwood inventory of Canada.
<P>
Tourism is the next most important economic sector.  Each year, about 15 million
people visit British Columbia.  With over five million hectares of parkland, the
Rocky Mountains remain the biggest attraction.  Coastal B.C., with its beaches,
hiking trails, artists' colonies, wildlife reserves, whale-sighting locales and other
attractions, is not far behind.  Of increasing attraction to visitors are the Queen
Charlotte Islands, large parts of which have recently been set aside as parkland. 
The area contains untouched wilderness and unique species of flora.  The
abandoned Haida village of Ninstints is of such historical and cultural importance
that it has been designated a world heritage site by UNESCO.
<P>
Mining is the province's third most important economic sector.  Copper, gold and
zinc are the leading metals extracted from B.C.; sulphur and asbestos are the
leading industrial minerals.  The most valuable resources, however, are coal,
petroleum and natural gas.
<P>
Agriculture and fishing, especially salmon fishing, are two other key sectors of the
economy of British Columbia, whose dairy cattle are among Canada's most
productive.  The valleys of the southern interior, principally the Okanagan Valley,
are famous for cultivation of tree fruits and grapes and for their wine industry.  The
cooler, wetter climate of the lower Fraser Valley produces rich crops of berries and
vegetables.
<P>
Manufacturing in B.C. is still largely resource-based, but is being gradually
diversified by high-tech and computer-based industries related to
telecommunications and the aerospace and sub-sea industries.  British Columbia
has the most balanced export market of all Canada's provinces, with the United
States, Japan, the European Union and the Pacific Rim countries as its
clientele.

Last update: 6th November, 1995
<hr>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
Warp's LaunchPad appears in lower left of screen upon loading.
<p>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
After the LaunchPad has been accidentally maximized, Warp automatically 
places it in the lower left of the screen when OS/2 or the LaunchPad is loaded.
Even if the LaunchPad is not actually maximized (which it shouldn't be)
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
The only way to stop the LaunchPad from being placed on the lower left corner is
to delete it (by right clicking on the LaunchPad icon or the LaunchPad itself and selecting
delete) and then reopen it (by double-clicking on the desktop or rebooting).
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
The LaunchPad is not actually supposed to have the ability to maximize, but due to the
design of the workplace shell, the LaunchPad can be caused to maximize in ways other
than the normal right-clicking and selecting maximize (since that is not available).

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</H2>
<P><IMG SRC="online-1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=10 WIDTH=106 HEIGHT=196 ALT="Blue Ribbon">
The plaintiffs in this <I>First Amendment</I> challenge to the <I>Communications
Decency Act of 1996</I> seek emergency relief to stop the enforcement of
provisions of the Act that criminalize their expression of constitutionally
protected information and ideas over computer communications systems/1. The Act
bans all expression that is &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot;
from all online systems that are accessible to minors. Not only does this ban
unconstitutionally restrict the <I>First Amendment</I> rights of minors and
those who communicate with them about important issues, but, because of the
nature of the online medium, it essentially bans &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; speech entirely, thus impermissibly reducing the adult
population to &quot;only what is fit for children.&quot; <I>Butler v. Michigan</I>,
352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957). </P>
<P>The prohibitions are also unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. The terms &quot;indecency&quot;
and &quot;patently offensive&quot; are not further defined. None of the
plaintiffs knows how to define the Act's terms or how much of their
communications are criminal under the Act. The Act explains neither how to
comply, nor which participants in the distribution of online speech may be held
liable. Further, there are many alternatives already available for those parents
who wish to shield their children from online communications that they deem
inappropriate. Finally, the Act interferes with the privacy rights of minors,
and impermissibly discriminates against computer communications by imposing
censorship that would not be permitted for the print medium/2. </P>
<P>The plaintiffs are providers and users of online communications with
significant educational, political, medical, artistic, literary, and social
value that deal with issues such as sexuality, reproduction, human rights, and
civil liberties. The censorship provisions that they challenge threaten not only
to chill these important communications but to dismantle the free and open
nature of a promising new medium that could empower citizens and promote
democracy in the next millennium. The exponential growth in computer technology,
and international computer networks like the Internet, is transforming the
nature of communication. Computer networks have created new communities with new
opportunities for people with similar interests to communicate with each other.
Computer networks embody the values that underlie the <I>First Amendment</I> by
nurturing the robust exchange of ideas. By imposing vague and broad-ranging
standards wholly inappropriate for this new medium, the Act would stifle the
creativity and breadth of expression occurring in cyberspace. This result cannot
be reconciled with the <I>First Amendment</I>. Because plaintiffs and their
members and online audiences face the irreparable loss of <I>First Amendment</I>
rights, plaintiffs ask the Court to enter preliminary relief enjoining the Act's enforcement.</P>

<h4>Fault</h4>
WPS Locks at boot
<h4>Additional Factors</h4>
System is running ccMail for WPS
<h4>Possible Cause</h4>
An open drive tree folder was one of the restarted
objects.

<h4>Solution</h4>
Ensure all drive tree folders are closed before shutting
down.
<hr>
<h4>Fault</h4>
When using DOS/Windows programs one of the shift keys seem
s locked down.
<h4>Solution</h4>
Depress offending key several times (remembering that there
are two of each type.
<hr>
<h4>Fault</h4>
DOS Programs appear to halt while running.
<h4>Cause</h4>
OS/2 sometimes erronously thinks that a DOS program is
idle when in fact it's just checking for keypresses a lot. For some reason OS/2
doesn't notice that other INT 21 calls are being issued :(
<h4>Solution</h4>
Turn off idle detection and put up with the system
performance "hit". or hold down one of the shift keys (for long jobs a
moderately heavy object can be balanced on the left control key.

<title>Fact Sheet:  Northwest Territories</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->

<p>
<h1>Northwest Territories</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<h3>The Land</h3>
<P>
The Northwest Territories (N.W.T.) includes all of Canada north of the 60th
parallel, except the Yukon and portions of Quebec and Newfoundland.  From the
60th parallel, the N.W.T. stretches 3560 km to the North Pole, and 4256 km from
east to west, covering 3 426 320 km<em sup>2</em>, and including the islands in
Hudson, James and Ungava bays.
<p>
At some time in its history, the Northwest Territories has included all of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and the Yukon, and most of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.  Today,
the Northwest Territories remains the largest political subdivision in Canada, with
34.1 percent of the total area of the country.  The N.W.T. is divided into three
districts: Keewatin, Mackenzie and Franklin.
<P>
One of the most remarkable features of the N.W.T. is the Mackenzie River, one of
the world's longest at 4241 km.  Like the Yukon, the N.W.T. can be divided into
two broad geographical regions: the taiga, a boreal forest belt that circles the
subarctic zone, and the tundra, a rocky arctic region where the cold climate has
stunted vegetation. 
<P>
<h3></h3>There are two major climate zones in the N.W.T.: subarctic and arctic. 
Average temperatures in January are -23&#186;C (subarctic) and -26&#186;C to -
33&#186;C (arctic), and in July 21&#186;C (subarctic) and 10&#186;C (arctic). 
As in the Yukon, the varying amounts of daylight over the year are an important
influence on the climate:  between 20 and 24 hours of daylight in June and up to
24 hours of darkness in December.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The ancestors of the Dene Indian people lived along the Mackenzie Valley in the
N.W.T. 10 000 years ago.  The first Inuit are believed to have crossed the Bering
Strait about 5000 years ago, spreading east along the Arctic coast.
<P>
The first European explorers were the Vikings, who sailed to the eastern Arctic
about 1000 A.D.  However, Martin Frobisher's expeditions in the 1570s were the
first recorded visits to the Northwest Territories by an explorer.  In 1610, Henry
Hudson, while looking for a passage to Asia, landed briefly on the western shore of
the bay that now bears his name.  His discovery opened the door for further
exploration of the interior of the continent.
<P>
With the arrival of the fur traders in the late 1700s and the whalers in the 1800s,
life began to change substantially.  The Europeans reshaped the North, bringing
with them a new economy and way of life.  Communities grew around trading
posts, mission schools and Royal Canadian Mounted Police stations with the arrival
 of fur traders, missionaries and government officials.
<P>
In 1870, the British government transferred control of the North-Western Territory
to Canada.   Ten years later the British government annexed the islands of the
arctic archipelago, which also became part of the Territories.  In 1905, both
Alberta and Saskatchewan were created from the Territories.  Finally, in 1912, the
provinces of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec were enlarged and the Northwest
Territories assumed its current boundaries.
<P>
By World War II, mineral exploration and the military were playing a role in northern
development, prompting a more active interest in the N.W.T. by the rest of
Canada.
<P>
The N.W.T. government to a large extent has the same responsibilities as provincial
governments: taxation, municipal bodies, education, wildlife, health and hospital
services, forest management, housing, social services and economic development. 
It lacks jurisdiction over land and resource administration, including control over the
pace and scale of resource development, and subsurface and water rights.  A 1988
agreement to negotiate a northern energy accord, however, will lead to territorial
management and control of onshore oil and gas and shared responsibility with the
federal government for offshore renewable resources.
<h3><P>
</h3>As in the Yukon, the issue of settling Aboriginal land claims in the N.W.T.
emerged in the 1970s.  In 1984, a final agreement was reached with the Inuvialuit
of the western Arctic; it provided some 2500 people with 91 000 km<em
sup>2</em> of land, financial compensation, social development funding, hunting
rights and a greater role in wildlife management, conservation and environmental
protection.
<P>
In 1992, the Gwich'in settled a comprehensive land claim that provided 22 422
km<em sup>2</em> of land in the northwestern portion of the N.W.T. and 1554
km<em sup>2</em> of land in the Yukon, subsurface rights, a share in the resource
royalties derived from the Mackenzie River Valley, tax-free capital transfers,
hunting rights, a greater role in the management of wildlife, land and the
environment, and the right of first refusal on a variety of activities related to
wildlife.
<P>
In 1993, a final agreement was reached with the Tungavik Federation of Nunavut  -
- the largest comprehensive land claim to be settled in Canada.  The agreement will
provide some 17 500 Inuit of the eastern Arctic with 350 000 km<em sup>2</em>
of land, financial compensation, the right to share in resource royalties, hunting
rights, and a greater role in the management of land and the environment.  The
final agreement also commits the federal government to a process that will divide
the N.W.T. and create the new territory of Nunavut.
<p>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
The N.W.T. is the only place in Canada where most of the population are
 Aboriginals (30 525 out of 52 238).  Most live in small communities; Yellowknife,
the capital, has a population of more than 15 000.
<p>
The largest Aboriginal group is the Inuit, which means "the people" in
Inuktitut.
Inuit communities are often a mixture of people from different cultural and linguistic
areas.  Most communities, however, have characteristic dialects.
In general, the Inuit language is a "living" language, and most Inuit children learn
Inuktitut as their mother tongue.
<P>
In the western Arctic, the Dene have inhabited the forests and barrens for the past
2500 years.  Once nomads, today they live in communities, many still using
traditional skills of hunting, trapping and fishing.  There are four major Dene
cultural and linguistic groups:  Chipewyan, Dogrib, Slavey (north and south) and
Gwich'in (Loucheux).
<P>
<h3>The Economy</h3>
<P>
Mining, with mineral production valued at over $800 million, is by far the largest
private sector of the N.W.T. economy.  Oil and gas exploration and development
are also important, but the industry is open to wide fluctuations in world
markets.
<P>
The Aboriginal peoples' traditional subsistence activities -- fishing, hunting and
trapping -- also have an impact on the N.W.T. economy.  Sports fishing and big-
game hunting also play a small role.  Commercial fishery development in the
N.W.T. -- freshwater and saltwater -- is being encouraged.  Fur harvesting
continues to be very important, supplementing the income of many Aboriginal
families.
<P>
Inuit arts and crafts distribute a greater amount of income more widely than any
other economic activity.  One in 14 people of working age in the N.W.T. earns
some income by this means.
<P>
Recently, tourism has become increasingly important.  The N.W.T. offers a variety
of landscapes of great natural beauty, conducive to fishing, wildlife observation
and other outdoor activities.
<P>
The settling of northern land claims sets the stage for increased economic activity
in which all can share and have a voice.  However, development, which is
welcome and necessary for economic prosperity, must be managed so as not to
threaten the fragile arctic ecosystem and the traditional lifestyles of the northern
peoples.
<P>
The Arctic Environmental Strategy introduced by the federal government in 1991
as part of its Green Plan, involves northerners in projects to protect the arctic
environment.  It also supports communities in the development of their own plans
to deal with environmental issues.

<title>Mixed Mode Semaphore Support</title>
<h2>Mixed Mode Semaphore Support</h2>
Last Updated: 18th January, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
32-bit Multithreaded Client Software which uses the 16-bit PDBLIB.DLL
SQL Server Communications Library no longer function.  Other applications
which mix 16-bit semaphore functions with 32-bit semaphore functions
will be affected.  Typically, the 16-bit functions are contained in
a DLL which is provided in pre-compiled format and not in source form.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
This is a kernel problem and not hardware related.
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
The WARP Kernel appears to be mixing the 16-bit semaphore table and the
32-bit semaphore table.  This causes the 16-bit semaphores to fail to
work correctly because the implementation of semaphores was changed
between the 16-bit versions of OS/2 and the 32-bit versions of OS/2
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
The work-around is to either recompile the 32-bit client software to
use the Single Thread runtime library.
<p>
This problem is in solution and has been assigned APAR PJ08330.

<title>Fact Sheet:  The Yukon Territory</title>
<!--This document was created on May 1, 1995 by Paul A. Canniff, Canniff and Company on behalf of the Canadian Embassy, Washington, DC-->

<h1>The Yukon</h1>
<hr>
</center>

<P>
<h3>The Land</h3>

<P>
The Yukon Territory in Canada's northwest covers 483 450 km<em sup>2</em>. 
The perimeters of this mountainous territory form a rough triangle bordered on the
south by British Columbia, on the west by the U.S. state of Alaska and on the east
by the Northwest Territories.  The northern tip of the triangle meets the chilly
waters of the Beaufort Sea.  Mount Logan, Canada's highest peak at 6000 m, is
located in southwestern Yukon.
<P>
The Yukon can be divided into two broad geographical regions: taiga and tundra. 
Taiga is the boreal forest belt that circles the world in the subarctic zone, including
most of the Yukon.  Tundra is the vast, rocky plain in the arctic regions, where the
extreme climate has stunted vegetation.
<P>
The Yukon has a subarctic climate.  The high altitude of much of the territory and
the semi-arid climate provide relatively warm summers with temperatures
frequently reaching 25&#186;C or more during the long summer days.  In winter
the temperature ranges between +4 and -50&#186;C in the south and slightly
colder farther north. 
<P>
Above the Arctic Circle (latitude 66&#186; north ), the Yukon is known as "the
land of the midnight sun" because for three months in summer, sunlight is almost
continuous.  In winter, however, darkness sets in, and the light of day is not seen
for a quarter of the year.
<P>
<h3>The History</h3>
<P>
The name Yukon was first used by the Hudson's Bay Company trader John Bell in
1846.  He called it "Yucon," derived from the Loucheux Indian word "Yuchoo,"
meaning the greatest river.  The Yukon River is the fifth-longest in North
America.
<P>
<h3></h3>The Yukon was the first area in Canada to be settled by people. 
Anthropologists believe the ancestors of the Amerindians may have inhabited the
Yukon 10 000 to 25 000 years ago when they migrated from Asia across a Bering
Sea land bridge.
<P>
The first modern European visitors were Russian explorers who travelled along the
coast in the 18th century and traded with the area's Indians.  Sir John Franklin
anchored off the Yukon's arctic coastline in 1825, and the Hudson's Bay Company
moved into the interior in the 1840s.
<P>
U.S. traders arrived after the 1867 Russian sale of Alaska to the United States. 
With the discovery of gold near Dawson City in 1896, the Klondike became one of
the most populous regions in northwestern Canada.  The sudden increase in
 population during the Klondike gold rush prompted the federal government to give
the Yukon more control over its affairs.  In 1898, the Yukon Territory was officially
established to ensure Canadian jurisdiction; the Yukon Act provided for a
commissioner and an elected legislative assembly. 
<P>
Some 40 years later, during the Second World War, the United States built the
Alaska Highway, creating a new overland transportation route.  In 1979, the
Canadian government opened the Dempster Highway, Canada's first all-weather
road to cross the Arctic Circle.
<P>
As a territory, the Yukon does not have full provincial status, although it achieved
a style of government similar to that of the provinces in 1979.  The Canadian
government retains administrative control over water, land and forestry, and over
the development of all non-renewable resources (i.e. minerals, oil and gas).
<P>
However, in 1993, the Canada-Yukon Oil and Gas Accord was signed, which will
lead to the transfer of authority and control over onshore oil and gas resources
from the federal to the Yukon government.  The agreement provides a commitment
to negotiate shared management of oil and gas resources in the Beaufort Sea and
ensures that the Yukon is a beneficiary of onshore and offshore oil and gas
revenues.  Other agreements have been signed for transfer of authority and control
in forestry, fishery and transportation.
<P>
The federal government operates nursing stations in all the larger centres.  All other
government programs -- police services, social services, transportation, economic
development, human resource programs, taxation, community services, tourism,
housing, justice and education -- are administered by the Yukon government.<P>

The 1970s saw the emergence of the Yukon Indian land claims
negotiations. In 1993, the Council for Yukon Indians, the Government of Canada
and the Yukon territorial government signed an Umbrella Final Agreement that sets
out the terms for final land claim settlements in the Territory.  Final land claim
agreements were also reached with the Vuntut Gwich'in First Nation, the
Champagne and Aishihik First Nation, the Teslin Tlingit Council and the First Nation
of Nacho Nyak Dun.  These agreements contribute to certainty of land title, and
benefits include cash, land and participation in wildlife and other management
boards.
<P>
In addition to their land claim settlements, the four First Nations also negotiated
self-government agreements that give them more control over land use on
settlement lands and greater authority in areas such as language, health care,
social services and education.
<P>
<h3>The People</h3>
<P>
The Yukon's vast interior forests were occupied by the Athapaskans, whose
cultural and linguistic traditions go back more than 1000 years.  Today, there are
 six distinct groups of Athapaskan Indians: Kutchin, Han, Tutchone, Inland Tlingit,
Kaska and Tagish. 
<P>
At present, 27 797 people live in the Yukon; 23 percent of the population is
Aboriginal.  Almost 60 percent of the population lives in Whitehorse, Yukon's
capital city.<P>

The Economy</h3>
<P>
Mining, the Yukon's largest industry, accounts for more than 30 percent of the
economy.  Tourism, offering a wilderness experience in a unique and relatively
unspoiled environment, provides a further base for jobs and services.  To reduce
reliance on these two industries and on government, efforts have recently been
made to promote sectors such as the forest industry.
<P>
The fur trade is important for about 3 percent of the population, mainly Aboriginal. 
A small fishing industry operates in Dawson City to export salmon, and other
commercial fisheries supply local consumers.
<P>
Agriculture -- expensive by North American standards -- is a small but expanding
industry.  Although growth of the agricultural industry is limited by climate and the
availability of productive land, new research programs hold promise for the
future.

<H2><A NAME="0">Intel Skips Sex Without Being Hexed</A></H2>
<P><B><I>Intel</I></B> has announced initial shipment of their sixth
generation of personal computer chips, code named the &quot;<B>P6</B>,&quot;
has been named the <B><I>Pentium Pro</I></B>.</P>
<P>This alleviates speculation by pundits that they might follow the logical
progression from <B><I>Pentium</I></B> to <B><I>Sextium</I></B>--can you
imagine <B><I>New York City</I></B> buses with sexy computer chip ads instead
of scantily-clad children wearing <B><I>Calvin Klein jeans</I></B>? <B><I>Intel</I></B> 
might even have used the same advertising agency which <B><I>Microsoft</I></B> 
used during <B><I>COMDEX Fall</I></B> in Los Vegas a few years ago--a
fleet of taxis advertised <B><I>Microsoft Office</I></B> on their roof and
<B><I>The Girls of Glitter Gulch--Topless--No Cover</I></B> on their rear.</P>
<P><B><I>IBM</I></B>, was confronted with a similar challenge in the 1960's,
when they set out to convert the industry to base-16 arithmetic. They introduced
the term <B><I>hexadecimal</I></B>. That probably would have flopped in these
days of political correctness, amidst efforts to ban Halloween activities in
schools.</P> 
<P><IMG SRC="online02.gif" ALT=""></P> 
<P>Word is that the <B><I>Pentium Pro</I></B> will be a very hot chip. Quite
literally, hot; drawing a few times as much electrical power as fifth generation
<B><I>Pentiums</I></B>, turning most of that power into heat. Even allowing
for electrical power reductions by <B><I>Intel</I></B> engineers as the design
matures, the heat will surely play a bigger factor in PC case and motherboard
design.</P>
<P>The <B><I>Pentium Pro</I></B> chip achieves much of its performance gain
only when it is running <B><I>true 32-bit applications</I></B>. While an
increasing number of application programs claim to be <B><I>32-bit</I></B>, in
actuality they often are a hybrid--like <B><I>Windows 95</I></B> they carry
along a lot of <B><I>16-bit baggage</I></B> from their past.</P>

<H2><A NAME="1">While the Sun Shines Bright</A></H2>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
<B><I>Sun Microsystems</I></B> has announced a new line of <B><I>RISC
servers and workstations</I></B>, based on <B><I>Sun's</I></B> line of <B><I>64-bit
UltraSparc chips</I></B>. With performance of 4 times that of older systems,
<B><I>multimedia and high speed network applications</I></B> are their forte.
<P>A vast majority of the workhorse servers on the Internet are <B><I>Sun</I></B>
computers. It is not unusual to see large network news, email, or <I>Web</I>
servers which have been running for months since they've last been
rebooted. While there are also many <B><I>Pentium</I></B>-based hosts
(typically also running <B><I>Unix</I></B>, occasionally <B><I>Windows NT</I></B>), 
such computers are often delegated to low to moderate workload tasks.</P>
<P><B><I>Sun Microsystems</I></B> will no doubt give <B><I>Microsoft</I></B> 
a run for their money in Internet application software. An alliance between
<B><I>Sun</I></B> and <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> promises to make <B><I>Sun's</I></B> 
powerful <B><I>Java</I></B> available to a much broader audience. As
the folks from Redmond struggle to gain a toe-hold in the Internet software
market, <B><I>Sun</I></B> and <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> are pushing the
envelope by leaps and bounds. For Java information, see <B>http://java.sun.com/</B>.</P></TD>

<B><I>Java</I></B> is hot! And no pun intended. What <B><I>Java</I></B>
does is allow applets to be downloaded from a Web site, and then run within your
browser, on your computer. Spectacular animations are just a few of the many
possibilities. <B><I>Bill Gates</I></B> may well have told the business press
that &quot;<B><I>Java</I></B> is just another of the many, many languages
which will run under <B><I>Windows</I></B>;&quot; but no doubt his kids in the
labs have been given much strong marching orders.</P> 

<P><B><I>Sun Microsystems</I></B> sure has its plate full, taking on giants
<B><I>Intel</I></B> on the hardware front and <B><I>Microsoft</I></B> in the
software arena. <B><I>Sun</I></B> has the ability to dazzle folks with product
performance. Besides, their customers are impressed with results, while largely
indifferent to marketing hype.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="online08.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="">
In early October <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> made available a first &quot;beta&quot;
release of a new version 2.0 of their <B><I>Netscape Navigator</I></B> Web
browser. By the time you read this, they'll likely have a few beta releases
under their belts. If past experiences are any guide, there will likely be about
a half dozen beta releases, over a several month period, before a stable and
robust version is ready to ship.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="online09.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="">
The first beta includes quite a few new, nifty, and in some cases
experimental features. As you'd expect from a first beta, it also has some very
rough edges, and some outright bugs. Don't expect a beta version to serve as
your every-day Web browser, but you might well want to play with it. Visit the
<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> home page at: <B>http://www.netscape.com/</B> to pick up a copy.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="3">Netscape Bugs Bounty</A></H2>
<P><IMG SRC="online10.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="">
Netscape has announced a new program which will reward people who report
bugs in their beta test versions of their <B><I>Netscape Navigator</I></B> Web

<P>The first person outside of <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A> who finds each bug gets
entered into a drawing, to be held after the products ship, for one of fifty
nifty <B><I>Netscape Mozilla</I></B> mugs and fifty snazzy <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When using the Netware Requester v. 2.10 or 2.11, CID remote install fails
because PMWIN.DLL cannot be found.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
Any networked environment supporting Netware.
<h2>Problem</h2>
Starting with the 2.10 Netware Requester, Novell migrated from full screen
VIO messaging to Presentation Manager pop-up messaging.  They did this
in such a way that the requester code depended upon PMWIN.DLL and would
not run without it.
<h2>Procedure</h2>
Use the Netware 2.01 requester code.  This code is shipped with the
Netware 3.12 server, and can also be found the Hobbes CD-ROMs from 1993.
This code works adequately for the purpose of a CID install.
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
A detailed explanation of remote installation using Netware can be
found in IBM's red book, _OS/2 Version 2.x Remote Installation and
Maintenance_ (GG24-3780-xx).  An outline of the procedure for a fully
attended install with some personal insight follows:
<p>
The Netware server should have the OS/2 utilities in the sys:public\os2
directory and the OS/2 login utilities in the sys:login\os2 directory.
A directory structure needs to be created on the Netware server that
contains the OS/2 installation diskette contents.  You can do this with
the seimage.exe utility (found in the CID file on diskette 7) or, if
you have Warp on CD-ROM, you can simply xcopy the install images from
the CD-ROM to your Netware server.
<p>
To build the Disk0 and LT (LAN Transport or Disk1) diskettes use sedisk.exe.
Sedisk.exe can be unpacked from the CID file on diskette 7 or
in the corresponding directory on the CD.  Sedisk.exe has to be executed
from
a machine already running the version of OS/2 you will be installing.
<p>
And with OS/2 2.1 they stopped putting mouse.sys on the LT disk so for an
fully attended install you  need to put that back on the diskette and in the
config.sys.
<p>
In the config.sys,  set it up so that the OS/2 shell is sysinst2.exe the
redirected install image drive.  (Note: Sysinst2.exe is the attended
install program, rspinst.exe is for unattended response file driven
installs.)
Then use a call statement to run a command file that will map the
appropriate
drives.  When the resources are set up correctly the .cmd file exits and
sysinst2.exe takes over.
<p>
For Windows support with Warp w/o WinOS2, you can copy all the Windows
install
diskettes onto a directory on the server.  Then, when the install program
asks
you for the individual Windows diskettes to be put into drive a:, simply
change the "A:\" to the network path of your Windows directory.  For example
if you are installing OS/2 from z:\warp, you could have the Windows install
diskettes on z:\win31.  The install program will beep at you and ask you to
put the next Windows install diskette into  z:\windows, simply press the
enter
key and the install program will find the files it is looking for.  The
beeps are annoying, but it works.

<p>
One thing I noticed with Warp was that it was migrating extraneous
lines from the config.sys on the LT diskette into the the config.sys
of the installed OS/2.  So I have gotten in the habit of making
as few changes as possible to the config.sys created by sedisk.exe and
putting that function into my loop.cmd.  E.g. set sourcepath, path and
dpath changes go in the loop.cmd.
<p>
Another thing I've done is avoid the login scripts.  I've found that
LAN administrators tend to make changes to their login scripts that
can screw things up for the LT diskette.  So I either use the s parameter
to define a local script or just use the map command and not login
at all.
<p>
After the graphical phase of the install is over -- and before you reboot,
you can take advantage of the Warp install's ability to multitask by running
the Netware 2.11 install from the server.
<p>
There is a caveat here. Sysinst.exe will migrate the NW 2.01's dlls on to
the root of your install drive and these will not be cleaned up until the
first reboot after the completion of the install. If your next bootup is
as a full-fledged Netware 2.11 requester the 2.11 requester will grab
the 2.01 dlls in the root on bootup in preference to the 2.11 dlls in the
Netware directory.  This cripples the requester and locks the dlls in the
root as being in use -- so you can't delete them.
<p>
So when doing the requester install, save the config.sys the Netware 2.11
install creates as config.lan.  After the next install, cleanup is done
automatically, then copy the config.lan to config.sys and boot up as a
Netware requester the next time 'round.
<p>
If you install the Netware requester the way descibed above, it builds its
folders and objects on the maintenance desktop.  You may want to migrate
them to your production desktop.

<title>Embassy of Canada WWW Site:  U.S. Customs Compliance Measurement </title>
</head>
<body>
<CENTER><H2>U.S. Customs Compliance Measurement</H2></CENTER>
<HR WIDTH=75% ALIGN=center SIZE=4>
<p>

	Each day, more than $1 billion worth of trade crosses the Canada-U.S. border!  Because of this tremendous growth in trade, governments on both sides of our border are searching for new ways to facilitate legitimate trade while at the same time protecting
 consumers against illegal or unsafe imports.  The U.S. Customs Service has taken a new  approach to cross-border trade, one that moves away from the traditional, inspector-intensive approach (the &quot;gotcha&quot; method) and into a new era of a &quot;s
hared partnership&quot; with importers.  This new approach presents Canadian exporters with an important opportunity to facilitate the entry of shipments to the United States. 
<p>
	The U.S. Congress and the General Accounting Office (GAO) have for years pressed the U.S. Customs Service to improve its inability to assess definitively the extent to which imports comply with U.S. trade laws.  For example, are imports properly marked w
ith the country of origin, are they properly classified under the Tariff Schedule, do the quantities declared on shipping documents accurately reflect the actual number or weights on the carrier?  
<p>
	In late 1993, Congress passed the Customs Modernization Act with the goal of increasing the level of international compliance with U.S. import requirements.  This new law not only shifts the legal burden for proper entry filing onto the importer, it spec
ifically required the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a Customs Compliance Measurement Program.  Customs launched this program nationwide in October 1994.   Since the Program's implementation, Customs field personnel have been conducting intensive 
examinations and document reviews of randomly selected shipments nationwide. Selected importations are often subject to complete unloading and the cargo and accompanying entry documents are thoroughly reviewed for accuracy and thoroughness.  
<p>
	Having assessed the compliance level of all commodities during the Program's first year, the agency claims it will &quot;fine tune&quot; its random selection process to focus on those commodities and to work closely with those industries that have demons
trated low compliance results.  Customs view of the future is to develop a more &quot;informed&quot; importing community, to abandon past efforts to inspect all or portions of every shipment and to move towards a more strategic, focussed approach to trade
 management.  According to recent remarks by Assistant Commissioner, Charles Winwood, Customs hopes to establish &quot;a trade compliance process that achieves high levels of compliance and reduces cycle times required for imports to clear Customs&quot;. 

<p>
	U.S. Customs policy is to share results of compliance reviews with the trade community through a series of trade &quot;outreach&quot; sessions and direct intervention with affected parties.  Importers with consistently high compliance performances could 
eventually be accorded &quot;certified or gold account&quot; status, with tailored or facilitative reporting requirements and fewer, if any, delays for their cargo.	In the long run, the total number of examinations of Canadian exports generally should be 
reduced if imports from Canada demonstrate high levels of compliance under the program.  In contrast, demonstrated low results can be expected to generate more intensive scrutiny for some commodity categories at U.S. ports of entry. 
<p>
	The published results for the first six months of the Compliance Measurement Program reveal several areas where compliance levels for some Canadian exporters have room for improvement.  For the most part, Canadian compliance discrepancies have been due t
o improper statistical and tariff classification, improper country of origin marking, or incorrect valuation.
<p>
	In order to establish sound track records under the program and ultimately benefit from the shift in focus of the Customs Service, Canadian exporters are being urged to take a more proactive role in their cross-border transactions.  In many of their outr
each sessions, Customs managers have suggested that companies review their Customs-related procedures for accuracy and thoroughness and to work closely with their brokers to ensure that entry documents are properly presented and commodities are accurately
 classified.  For their part, shippers should ensure that cargo is efficiently packaged and loaded to facilitate Customs examination.
<p>
	In FY1994, the U.S. Customs Service processed nearly 12 million formal commercial entries.  Inspectors carried out 365,000 intensive exams of merchandise.  These numbers, on both sides of our border, will continue to rise in the years to come.  Exporters
 will need to adjust to the demands of this growth while adapting to a rapidly changing international trade environment.   Border entry procedures should be viewed less as a matter of logistics than an integral part of a company's strategy and organizatio
ns.  Those exporters able to respond to these changes and who know the rules and play by the rules will reap the benefits of a far more automated and streamlined border.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
TCP/IP not working correctly on Token Ring when using the Netware
2.11
requester and ODI drivers.  Able to ping IP addresses on the local
ring
but not able to ping outside of the ring.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<pre>
Any Token Ring card in a source-routed environment
</pre>
<h2>Problem</h2>
The ROUTE.SYS (dated 10-20-94 5:52p with a size of  47488  bytes)
in the 2.11 requester has a rather large bug.  It will
not set the source-routing bit the second frame type--usually
token-ring_snap.

While you are using ODI drivers, you depend on the Netware code to
mark
the token-ring_snap frames as source-routable.  This means that if
you
are using IBM's TCP/IP but not the NDIS drivers you are vulnerable.
You
are also vulnerable if you are using LAN Workplace for OS/2 with
either NDIS
or ODI adapter drivers.

TCP/IP on Token Ring defaults to the token-ring_snap frame type and
if the frames are not marked source-routable, the frame won't get
past the
closest Token Ring bridge.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
There are a couple of work arounds:
<p>
<ul>
<li>1. Use the NDIS drivers and ODI2NDI.  If you only have the
TCP/IP
     version of LAPS get the NTS/2 7045 CSD which contains
ODI2NDI.OS2.
     the 7045 CSD is available from IBM.  You can get this at:
<pre>
           <a href="ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/pub/os2/lanserv/">ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/pub/os2/lanserv</a>

</pre>
     All licensed users of LAPS (including IBM TCP/IP 2.0 users)
qualify for
     this CSD.
<p>
<li> 2. Use a route.sys from a older version of the Netware
Requester for OS/2.
     I have used a route.sys dated 8-12-93  10:58a  with a size of
45440 bytes
     successfully.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<img src="images/new.gif"> Novell now has a fix distributed in  R211FT.EXE dated  on or after
3-24-95.
<pre>
      <a href="ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/netwire/novfiles/client.kit/os2/fixes/r211ft.exe">ftp://ftp.novell.com/pub/netwire/novfiles/client.kit/os2/fixes/r211ft.exe</a>
</pre>
<p>
 To use the above URL wirh WE/2, be sure  your explore.ini is set up to
transfer .exe files as binary.

<H2>1995 Award for<br>
Canadian-American Business Achievement
<br>
Won by Automotive Industry Duo
</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
The first annual &quot;Award for Canadian-American Business Achievement&quot; has been awarded to two automotive parts firms for their innovative development of a business alliance between the U.S. and Canada.
<P>
<B>UAP Inc.</B> of Montreal, Quebec and <B>Genuine Parts Company</B> of Atlanta, Georgia received the award on June 8, 1995 from Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chr&eacute;tien at a black-tie affair gala at the Canadian Embassy.  Accepting the award were Jean
 Douville, CEO and Chairman of UAP and Larry Prince, CEO and Chairman of Genuine Parts Company.  The presentation, which took place in the Embassy theater, was comprised of speeches by the Ambassador; Frederick Stocker, President of the Foundation for Can
adian-American Business Achievement (FCABA); Jay Jaiswal, CEO and President of the founding sponsor organization, FHS International Inc.; and Peter Jost, President of the Canadian-American Business Council.

</font>
</center>
<p>
The UAP and Genuine Parts alliance represents a true partnerhship in the best sense of the word.  In 1989, recognizing the opportunities brought by the North American Free Trade Agreement, the two companies formed the UAP/NAPA Automotive Western Partnersh
ip, with UAP Inc. as the managing partner.  The alliance was formed to develop the Western Canadian market, while simultaneously enabling both companies to share market expertise to the benefit of their respective home markets.  Their teamwork inspired a 
number of innovations in the automotive aftermarkets of both countries, including the creation of private brand products in Canada, a market first.  The products have been backed by special consumer warrantees and dealer programs that have resulted in dra
matic growth, including human resource growth of 1900 to 440, while profits have increased 96 percent over the last three years.  The entire process was so successful, it is now being replicated in Mexico.
<P>
&quot;We are thrilled to have received a nomination for this alliance that so well met the Foundation's criteria in the inaugural year of this Award,&quot; said Frederick Stokcer, President of the FCABA.  &quot;The UAP and Genuine Parts project reflects t
he innovation, commitment and creativity the Foundation and its partners want to promote.  These winners establish a precedent for our Foundation that will serve as a standard for years to come.&quot;
<P>
An honourable mention was given to Visual Edge Software of Montreal and Hewlett-Packard of Fort Collins, Colorado.  Russell Ure of Visual Edge accepted a plaque at the June 8 ceremony on behalf of both firms.  The Workstation group at Hewlett Packard adop
ted Visual Edge's marketing strategy, while helping Visual Edge refine its approach and prepare for the worldwide market.  The sophisticated quality control systems Hewlett-Packard helped Visual Edge establish are still in use today.  The success of the r
elationship enabled Visual Edge to concentrate on research and development, while Hewlett-Packard focused on worldwide marketing and sales of their value-added product.
<P>
The Award winners were chosen by a prestigious bi-national panel of 7 judges.  The selection criteria include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>introduction of innovative products, technologies and/or services;<br>
<LI>innovative use of current technologies or resources;<br>
<LI>impact on the marketplace;<br>
<LI>successfully overcoming obstacles or barriers; and<br>
<LI>sustained growth and profitability over a three-year period.
</UL>
<P>
The deadline for nominations for the 1996 Award is March 1, 1996.  Nomination forms will be available this autumn.  Inquiries about the Award should be directed to<I> Ellen Maidman, Executive Director of the Canadian-American Business Council</I> at<b> (2

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
Attempts to get login.exe, attach.exe, to accept Netware passwords
from a file or as a parameter do not work.
<p>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
N/A
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
Login to a Netware server in an unattended mode was not
made easy by Novell under OS/2 Warp.  None of the command line
utilities that can attach you to a server will accept
re-directed passwords.  These utilities do not read STDIN
for password input.
<p>
Creating userids without passwords can result in security
and administration problems that may be unacceptable.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
If you must have a password for your userid, you can take
advantage of two features that Netware provides:
<p>
1. Within a login script, the attach command will
take a password as a parameter.
<p>
2. The login command will let you to over-ride the
use of a system login script and allow you to specify
your own.
<p>
You will  need access to a Netware server on your LAN that has
an ID which does not require a password.  The standard
guest id works well here.  By default the guest ID does not
require a password has minimal rights.  The login id that
you use in order to run your script needs no rights at all if
login.exe and the login script are on your local machine.
<p>
Example
<pre>
login command:
 -------  cut here -----------
login fs1/guest /s c:/netware/login.scr pswd1
 -------- cut here ----------

login.scr
 ------- cut here ---------

  attach fs2/userid1;%2
  attach fs3/userid2;pswd2
  attach fs4/userid3;pswd3
  attach fs5/userid4;pswd4

  map m:=fs2/sys:directory
  map n:=fs3/sys:directory/subdir
  map o:=fs4/sys:directory
  map p:=fs5/sys:

 ------- cut here -----------
</pre>
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
The password can either be passed as a parameter or embedded in the login
script.  E.g., above pswd1 is
passed in as a command line parameter of login.exe, and pswd2, pswd3, and
pswd4 are embedded in the
login script.
<p>
The example above uses different userids and different passwords for
different servers.  This is not
required and the same userid and password may be set up for all servers.
<p>
UNC (universal naming convention) names will allow you to store non-default
login scripts  on a server.
If you do this, make sure you pass the password as a parameter.  Embedding
it in the script when the
script is on the server may cause security problems.
<pre>
login fs1/guest /s //fs1/sys/public/mylogin.scr pswd1 pswd2 pswd3 pswd4

The extremely popular &quot;Technology Partnership Program&quot; is now accepting
Canadian and American participants for the 1995 sessions.
</font>
<p>
Presented by the Canadian Embassy in Washington, with the support of Foreign
Affairs, provincial governments and industry  associations, the TPP is the <b>absolute</b> best time and
cost saving method to  get  a  piece of the  U.S. Federal Informatics  market. This  year it
focuses  on 2 sectors:  <i>Informatics</i> and <i>Geomatics</i>. <b> Don't miss out!</b><p>
<p>
<h3>Who the Technology Partnership Program (TPP) is for:</h3><p>
<p>
Canadian companies wanting to  explore teaming or partnership arrangements  in
the U.S. sign  on with the Embassy.    American firms who are  looking for Canadian expertise to 
bolster contract opportunities  are invited  to submit  their &quot;shopping  list&quot; of  opportunities
to  the Canadian Embassy  in  Washington. There  are  30 U.S.  companies  this  year who  are  
seeking  Canadian Informatics  partners  in:

<p>
There are l5 U.S. Geomatics firms  (engineering firms and software integrators)
who are seeking Canadian Geomatics partners in:  
<p>
<ul type=circle>
<li>Geomatics products;<br>
<li>consulting engineering;<br>
<li>mapping;<br>
<li>photogrammetry;<br>
<li>remote sensing;<br>
<li>satellite imaging;<br>
<li>data conversion;<br>
<li>data analysis.<p>
</ul>
<p>
Strong Canadian candidates for this  program are those who are already exporting --  to the U.S.
and other countries -- and are willing to discuss opportunities that they can bring to potential U.S.partners. 
<p>

<h3>How This Program Differs From Others:</h3><p>
<p>
The TPP introduces you to current substantial business opportunities in the U.S.  It matches your
business  strengths with American partners  to win new contracts and  open doors to new business
opportunities and contacts in the  U.S.  TPP greatly  accelerates the process of making  contact
with senior  U.S. executives of  companies seeking  partnerships.  We  identify specific  export
opportunities, and work with you  to determine strategies that will lead to successful dealings with American companies.<p>
<p>
<h3>Key Dates &amp; Deadlines:</h3><p>
<p>
<b>March 29 to June l2</b><p>
One-half day information briefings are offered across Canada at various high-tech events. (See schedule listed at end of this document).<p>

<b>March 29 to June 12</b><p>
Canadian companies contact the program coordinator in Ottawa,
<p>

<pre>J. Allen

<p>
<b>October 10-12</b> <i>(for geomatics)</i><br>
<b>October 24-26</b> <i>(for informatics)</i><p>
Senior executives of successful Canadian firms participate in the partnership meetings in Washington.  There is a &#36;250 CDN participation fee to attend the events in Washington.
<p>
The Washington meetings include:<p>
<ul>
<li>matching meetings with your preselected American partners;<br>
<li>market intelligence briefings;<br>
<li>briefing on successful teaming agreement strategies;<br>
<li>hospitality and local industry association liaison with<br> 
      <ul type=square>

Last update: 6th November, 1995
<hr>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
When running Netware's OS/2 version LOGIN.EXE, Warp does not use the login 
script used by the DOS version of LOGIN.EXE.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
N/A
<h2>Problem</h2>
OS/2 uses its own login script, NET$LOG.OS2 rather than NET$LOG.DAT.  Many 
sites wish to standardize having all logins go through a single centralized login
script.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
You can point the OS/2 login script to the DOS login script by having putting
a single line in net$log.os2:
<pre>

        include sys:public\net$log.dat

</pre>
<p>
The login scripts reside on the server in the SYS:PUBLIC directory
<p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<h4>External Commands </h4>
Overall, the way Netware scripting works for OS/2 and DOS are very similar.  
But there are differences.  For example, the way external programs are
called.  With OS/2 scripts, having the command on the path is
sufficient, where with the DOS scripting you need to specify where the 
external command resides.  In the example below, the login script 
maps the P: drive to sys:public.  P:\OS2 is on both the path and dpath.
<pre>

IF OS="MSDOS" THEN
  MAP ROOT S1:=SYS:PUBLIC
ELSE
IF OS="OS2" THEN
  MAP P:=SYS:PUBLIC
END
END

IF MEMBER OF "PRN_0987_HP3D" and OS="MSDOS" THEN
  #sys:\public\CAPTURE /s=%FILE_SERVER /q=0987_HP3D /l=2 /nt /ti=15 /nff /b
ELSE
IF MEMBER OF "PRN_0987_HP3D" and OS="OS2" THEN
  #CAPTURE /s=%FILE_SERVER /q=0987_HP3D /l=2 /nt /nff /b
END
END
</pre>
You can also specify the external command using the UNC (Universal Naming
Convention) method e.g.:
<pre>
#\\FS1\SYS\PUBLIC\OS2\CAPTURE.EXE /s=%FILE_SERVER /q=0987_HP3D /l=2 /nt /nff /b
</pre>
however, commands that also need data pathing (dpath) may have problems
with this method as it only tells the system where to find the single
executable you specify.
<p>
<h4>OS/2 and Search Drives</h4>
This brings up another difference between DOS and OS/2 Netware scripting.
OS/2 does not support search drives.  So "MAP S1:", "MAP INS:" etc. do
not work.  Search drives were invented by Novell to overcome a couple of
DOS' deficiencies, the limited length available to the path statement, the
lack of data pathing capabilities in DOS 3.x and below, and that DOS
returns an error if an entry in the path does not exist.  These limitations
do not exist for OS/2.
<p>
The alternative to search drives for OS/2 is to predefine network paths 
in your the path and dpath statements in your config.sys.  The Netware 
Requester install program does this for you by putting P:\OS2 in both 
your path and dpath statements.  If your site does not define the
P: drive as being redirected to sys:public, you may wish to modify your
config.sys accordingly.
<p>
<h4>Other Netware Command  Differences </h4>
In the example above, you may have also noted another difference the MAP
command.  With OS/2, you do not need to explicitly "MAP ROOT"  and in all
OS/2 mapping "ROOT" is implied.  The fact is that the "ROOT" option for the
MAP command was not added until after the original OS/2 Netware requester
came out with its ability to map to a false root.  This feature was demanded
by users for the DOS version of MAP.EXE.
<p>
Also, in the example above, the parameters for CAPTURE are different.  Since
in OS/2 spooling of print files is a native function, the "/ti=99" (timeout)
parameter is not acceptable syntax.
<p>
<h4>Testing Which Operating System</h4>
The example above also shows how to test to test from which operating system
you login script is being run.  The script identifier variable, "OS" can be
tested upon so that when a command is only appropriate for only DOS or
only OS/2 will only be run in that environment.
<h4>Editing the Login script</h4>
SYSCON.EXE is the tool that Novell provides for editing login scripts.
Unfortunately the OS/2 version of this utility will only edit the OS/2
system login script and the DOS version of this utility will only edit
the DOS login script.  
<p>
As an administrator and an OS/2 user, you can run both utilities 
simultaneously on your PC -- the DOS utility requires that you virtualize 
IPX, run NETX and be set up as either a public or private session.
Or you can directly edit the script file using an OS/2 editor such as
EPM.EXE.  And you can also login in multiple private DOS sessions testing
the login script and rights for individual users and groups.

</center>
     <hr noshade>
<p>
     DFAIT's Trade Information Systems Division (TPP)
     recently launched its experimental electronic bulletin
     board service (BBS).  It can be reached at <b>1-613-944-1581</b>
     (line settings 8-N-1, speed up to 14,400 baud, ANSI/ASCII
     terminal emulation).  By registering on-line, globally active 
     companies can immediately register themselves into the 
     Department's WIN Exports database, by which they may receive 
     business opportunities from the commercial sections of
     Canada's embassies abroad.<p>
 
     TPP is developing the BBS on behalf of the Department's
     Infocentre.  The BBS complements the InfoCentre's<b> FAXLINK</b>
    <b> (613-944-4500</b>) and voice Hotline <b>(1-800-267-8376)</b> services.<p>
 
     This pilot BBS project is testing the demand for electronic
     dissemination of international business development and
     market information to Canadian SMEs.  The intent is to
     provide in one place on-line access to a comprehensive
     source of international market intelligence/information
     provided by DFAIT and other agencies.<p>
       
     The BBS is a full text information source:<p>
     <menu>
     <li>Menu driven with daily updates<br>
     <li>Available 24 hours, 7 days a week<br>
     <li>National, international, public and private sources<br>
     <li>Concerns all aspects of international business<br>
     <li>Search and download capabilities and <a href="#internet">E-mail link</a><p>
     </menu>
<a name=main><h3>Conferencing on the BBS </h3> </a>
   
     The &quot;main conference&quot; messaging service on the BBS
     allows for posting of questions and answers to all
     users of the BBS.  Therefore it has the potential to
     act as an &quot;exporters newsgroup&quot; similar to newsgroups
     found on the Internet.<p>
     
     Although the BBS has over 1600 files of documents in
     both official languages, several menus are incomplete.
     Therefore the BBS is still &quot;under construction&quot;.  However
     Trade Officers are being encouraged to send electronic
     copies of their newsletters, market studies, country
     profiles and trade mission reports to the BBS for posting
     and for further distribution.<p>


<a name=bus-dev><h3>International Business Development </h3></a>

     Despite being &quot;under construction&quot; there are a number of
     files and documents available related to international
     business development.  The BBS libraries&quot; contains all of
     the documents carried on the Department's FAXLINK service
     plus many others such as International Financial Institution
     Project Documents (PIDs) and monthly operational summary
     (MOS) reports for both the World Bank and the Inter-American
     Development Bank.<p>
 
     There is also a menu of documents related to export
     financing on the BBS.  This menu was developed during the
     summer of 1994 with the assistance of the Working Group on
     Information Co-operation which was composed of
     representatives from Canada's chartered banks and several
     federal government departments.  The menu contains an
     electronic version of the &quot;Road Map to Exporting and Export
     Financing&quot; publication which was also developed by the
     working group.  Furthermore, the BBS carries a number of
     publications from Canadian banks describing their trade
     finance services for exporters as well as the contact points
     for accessing those services.
 
     The BBS also has a number of &quot;conferences&quot; including one for
     "tools" which contains some of the shareware software the
     department has developed including the diagnostic program
     &quot;Are you Ready to Export&quot;.
    

<a name="internet"><h3>Internet Access</h3></a>

     In the longer term the intent is to make the BBS a
     gopher site on the Internet to facilitate transfer of
     documents.  But in the interim there is an Internet e-mail
     link for access to the listserver and FTP mail.  This
     e-mail Internet link will allow DFAIT to provide an
     electronic subscription service, via a list-server, for
     distribution of newsletters, reports, directories, etc, to
     Canadian exporters who wish to receive information by
     e-mail.<p>
 
     To access the listserver e-mail service send your Internet
     e-mail message to &quot;listserv@fait.gc.ca&quot; with the word &quot;help&quot; in
     the body only.  The BBS will return a description of the
     services provided by the listserver and how to access them.<p>
 
     To access the FTP e-mail service send your Internet
     e-mail message to &quot;ftpmail@fait.gc.ca&quot; with the word &quot;help&quot;
     in the body only.  The BBS will return a description of the
     services provided by &quot;ftpmail&quot; and how to access them.<p>
 
     To access the BBS using your personal computer and modem:<p>
     
     Direct Dial <i>[Ottawa]</i> <b>(613) 944-1581</b><p>
     
     - Modem to 14,400 baud, line settings N-8-1<br>
     - ANSI/ASCII terminal emulation<p>
 
     Outside of Ottawa<i> (but only in Canada)</i> the BBS may also be
     reached at <b>1-800-628-1581</b>.<p>
     
     The BBS will soon be available to Datapac users at
    <b> 2020049821</b>.<p>

TRAP0003 DISK #1 IBM1FLPY.ADD WARP OS/2. CS:EIP=0538:00001a21 CSLIM=000027d7
</h3>
Last updated: 27 Dec 1994
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    Installing WARP disk #1 failed with TRAP0003 on the following
    values: CS:EIP=0538:00001a21 CSLIM=000027d7.

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    On the system setup bios, check the SETUP for the
    floppy drive setup.  Make sure that the floppy drive is setup
    correctly.  Example: If user has 1.44mb (3 1/2") drive, make
    sure the setup reflects 1.44mb setup instead of 1.2mb (5 1/4").

<title>Canada-US Trade:  California</title>

<h2>Canada and the United States:  The World's Largest Trading Relationship</h2>
<h1>California</h1>
<hr><br>
Produced January 1995 by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<I> Canada and the United States are partners in the largest
bilateral exchange of goods and services in the world. In 1989, the
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect, eliminating all
tariffs, as well as many non-tariff barriers to trade. Since 1994,
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has opened the
Mexican market to both Canada and the United States.</I><P>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="calif1.gif">
<h3>Canada is one of California's best customers. </h3>Merchandise
trade between California and Canada totalled $11.18 billion in
1993. Canada purchased $5.63 billion in California-made goods,
while California imported $5.55 billion in merchandise from Canada
(not including natural gas transhipped through Washington).<br clear=all>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="calif2.gif">
<h3>From the products of the Silicon Valley... </h3>California's
leading export to Canada is high-tech electronics. In 1993, Canada
bought $1.14 billion in computers from California, as well as $342
million worth of telecommunications equipment and $207 million in
electronic tubes and semi-conductors. Canadaţs purchases create
highly-skilled jobs in California.<br clear=all>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="calif3.gif">
<h3>To the fruits of the Napa and San Fernando Valleys...
</h3>California shipped $1.23 billion worth of foodstuffs to Canada.
Fruits and vegetables accounted for 75%, making them Californiaţs
second largest export to Canada.
<P>
<h3>From planes, trains, and automobiles...</h3> California exported
$484 million in transportation equipment to Canada. Aircraft and
aircraft parts accounted for $259 million, or 54% of all exports of
transportation equipment. <P>
<P>
<h3>To services...</h3> California sold billions of dollars more in
services to Canada, including banking services, insurance,
telecommunications, and professional expertise, as well as movies,
recordings and other products of the entertainment industry. <P>
<P>
<h3>And tourism...</h3> In 1993, 831,800 Canadian tourists accounted
for $446 million in additional revenue for California.  Over  one
million Californians visited Canada and spent $350 million.<P>
<P>
<h3>California buys Canadian. </h3> California relies on Canadian
imports to keep its economy thriving. For example, almost $1
billion of Canadian natural gas transshiped through Washington
State and $1.72 billion of Canadian-built cars make Canada a vital
partner in California's economy. California also buys Canadian
software -- serving the needs of California's entertainment,
computer and telecommunications industries.
<P>
<h3>Canada buys Californian.</h3> From Newfoundland to British
Columbia, Canadians buy Californian goods. Ontario bought $3.23
billion of  California-made goods in 1993 -- over half of
 California's total exports to Canada.
<P>
<h3>Trade is expanding.</h3> Between 1989 and 1993, two-way
merchandise trade rose by 33%, bringing billions of dollars to both
California and Canada -- and, in the process, creating thousands of
jobs on both sides of the border.

<title>Canada-US Trade:  Indiana</title>

<h2>Canada and the United States:  The World's Largest Trading Relationship</h2>
<h1>Indiana</h1>
<hr><br>
Produced March 1995 by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada
<hr>
</center>
<p>

<I>In 1989, the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect,
phasing out all tariffs and many non-tariff barriers to trade.
Beginning in 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
opened the Mexican market to Canada and the United States. Two-way
merchandise trade between Canada and the United States totalled
$241 billion in 1994, the largest bilateral exchange in the world.
</I><P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="ind1.gif">
<h3>Canada and Indiana have a mutually beneficial exchange.</h3>In
1994 Canada and Indiana traded more than $6 billion worth of goods, 
providing each otherţs consumers and industries with vital products
and supporting thousands of jobs in both countries. Indiana sold
Canada $4.14 billion worth of goods and bought $2 billion worth,
giving the state a trade surplus of more than $2 billion.<br clear=all>
<P>
<h3>Motor vehicles and components form the heart of the trade</h3>.
The auto industries of Canada and the U.S. have been integrated
since the Auto Pact was signed in 1965. More than 40 per cent of
Indianaţs exports to Canada in 1994, $1.7 billion worth, were motor
vehicle parts. Automobiles and trucks accounted for another $208
million. Indiana bought $297 million worth of motor vehicles and
parts from Canada.<P>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="ind2.gif">
<h3>Canada and Indiana supply each other's industries</h3>. Indiana
sold Canada $290 worth of industrial and agricultural machinery and
bought $176 million worth. The state sold Canada $284 million worth
of fabricated metals -- aluminum, iron and steel, hardware, valves
and pipes -- and bought $375 million worth. Indiana and Canada also
exchanged chemicals, plastics and allied products -- Indiana sold
$182 million worth and bought $162 million worth.<P>
<P>
<h3>Canada's forests provide Indiana with wood and paper.</h3> Canada
supplied Indianaţs builders with $210 million worth of lumber and
other wood products and its printing presses with $158 million
worth of newsprint and other paper.

 .
 PMCOMM (version 2.11) will sometimes cause this trap to occur
 when a REXX script file is used.  This problem is identical to
 APAR PJ14545 which occurred in the OS/2 2.11 environment.
 .
 Only customers which match the EIP and CSLIM values should be
 added to the IP list of the APAR.
 
 
 LOCAL FIX:
 The trap is random and there is no known work around.  The
 suspect area in COM.SYS is the DosClose code. Customer's
 should try to terminate communications (i.e. hang up the modem)
 before closing the application.

<h2>Canada and the United States:  The World's Largest Trading Relationship</h2>
<h1>Tri-State Area:<br>
New York, New Jersey and Connecticutt</h1>
<hr><br>
Produced February 1995 by Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<I>Canada and the United States are partners in the largest
bilateral exchange of goods and services in the world. In 1989, the
Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect, phasing out
tariffs and many non-tariff barriers to trade. Since 1994, the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has opened the Mexican
market to both Canada and the United States.<P>
</I><P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="ny1.gif">
<h3>New York.</h3> Canada-New York trade is huge. Two-way merchandise trade totalled
$21.7 billion in 1993. Canada bought $6.3 billion in goods from New York, while
New York purchased $15.4 billion in merchandise from its northern neighbour.
Canadaţs imports from New York, including $770 million in electronics and $595
million in automobiles and other trans-portation equipment, employ New Yorkers in
high-tech, highly-skilled, and well-paying jobs. Canada supplies New York with
energy ($1.2 billion in natural gas and $120 million worth of electricity), vital
raw materials ($2.4 million  in metals and basic metal products), forest products
($1.1 billion worth) and transportation ($4.2 billion in cars and trucks).<P>
<P>
Canadians visit New York more than any other state. In 1993, 3.3 million Canadian
tourists spent more than $495 million in the state.<P>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="nj1.gif">
<h3>New Jersey</h3>. Canada-New Jersey trade is diversified and growing. Merchandise
trade between Canada and New Jersey reached $4.6 billion in 1993. New Jersey
exported $2 billion in merchandise to Canada.  In addition to large purchases of
personal and household goods, foodstuffs, transportation equipment, and
pharmaceuticals, Canada also buys a huge amount of chemicals and allied products
from New Jersey. Sales of chemicals have grown by 34% since 1989 to $474 million,
or 23% of New Jerseyţs total exports to Canada. New Jersey bought $2.6 billion
worth of goods from Canada. The state's largest import was fabricated metals, $499
million worth, including $103 million in copper, $146 million in nickel and $74
million in precious metals.
<P>
In 1993, 430,000 Canadian tourists spent more than one night and $111 million in
New Jersey, while 327,000 residents of the state spent a comparable amount in
Canada.<P>
<h3><P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="ct1.gif">
Connecticut.</h3> The Constitution State traded $2.3 billion worth of merchandise
with Canada in 1993. The exchange was almost in balance, with exports to Canada
of $1.2 billion and imports of $1.1 billion. Connecticutţs leading export was $188
million worth of chemicals, plastics and related products. It also sold $106
million worth of pharmaceuticals, $103 million worth of industrial and
agricultural machinery, $97 million worth of aircraft parts and $34 million worth
of books and other printed matter. Canada supplied Connecticut with $89 million
worth of lumber and wood products, $91 million worth of pulp and paper, $123
million worth of copper and $113 million worth of aircraft and parts.
<P>
Almost 123,000 Canadian tourists spent more than one night and  $19 million in
Connecticut in 1993, and 202,000 Connecticut residents spent $65 million in
Canada.<P>

<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="ny2.gif">
<h3>From high-tech electronics...</h3> Among New York's largest
exports to Canada is electronic equipment. In 1993, Canada bought
over $770 million worth. Telecommunications equipment accounted for
59% or $454 million. Computers and other office equipment
constituted an additional $227 million or 29% of all the
electronics New York sold to Canada. Canadian purchases of New
York's high-tech products create highly-skilled, well-paid jobs in
the Empire State.<P>
<P>
<h3>To personal and household goods... </h3>Canada bought $766
million in personal and household goods from New York. Unexposed
film and other photographic goods totalled $370 million or 48% of

newspapers, books, and other printed matter to Canada accounted for
$238 million or 31%.<br clear=all>
<P>
<h3>And tourism...</h3> Canadians visit New York more than any other
state. In 1993,  3.3 million Canadian tourists injected more than
$495 million into the New York economy by filling up hotel rooms,
eating in New York's restaurants, and seeing some of New York's
famous sights.<P>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="ny3.gif">
<h3>Canada is buying more from New York.</h3> Between 1989 and 1993,
Canadian purchases of New York-made goods grew by $800 million or
15%. Canada's ever-increasing purchases of merchandise produced in
New York help keep the New York economy thriving and support New
York jobs.<P>
<P>
<h3>From planes, trains, and automobiles... </h3>New Yorkers bought
$3.4 billion in automobiles and $1.2 billion in other
transportation equipment from Canada in 1993. Altogether,
transportation equipment totalled $4.7 billion or 30% of New York's
imports from Canada.<br clear=all>
<P>
<h3>To raw materials...</h3> Canada supplied New York industry and
consumers with natural gas ($1.2 billion) and electricity ($120
million), metals and basic metal products ($2.4 billion), wood
($294 million) and pulp, newsprint  and other paper ($763
million).<p>
<P>
<h3>New York is buying more from Canada. </h3>Between 1989 and 1993,
New York's purchases of Canadian-made goods grew by $3.2 billion,

<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    Installation of WARP, on Disk 1 received the following error:
    "A program in this session encountered a problem and
     cannot continue.
     c0000005
     P1 =00000000 P2 =ffffffff P3 =xxxxxxxx P4 =xxxxxxxx

     EBP=00000433 FLG=00013202

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    Check the CONFIG.SYS, user has edited this file and instead of
    putting " REM " for remarks out the statement, user put a non
    alphabet characters.  For example, instead of the following:
    REM basedev=ibm1s506.add
    user has put
    ;basedev=ibm1s506.add  (a semi-colon " ; ")
    This above will result the c0000005 error on disk #1.


</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    Make sure the user does not use any non alphabet characters for
    any statements on the config.sys.
    Under OS/2, everytime a statement needs to be REMarks out,
    user REM instead of ";" or non alphabet characters.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<img src="../images/new.gif">
Andreas Toenne (atoenne@mpi-sb.mpg.de) writes:

<p>
Trap c0...05  is not only raised when config.sys does include non
alphabet characters but also when the user mistyped a keyword.
<p>
Example: I added the line 
<pre>
   BASEDEF OS2CAM.ADD
</pre>
<p>
for my NCR SCSI controller, obviously mistyping the keyword BASEDEV.
Warp raised a trap c5 (and my hairs :-)

Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement went into effect, eliminating all
tariffs, as well as many non-tariff barriers to trade. Since 1994,
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has opened the
Mexican market to both Canada and the United States.<P>

 ERROR DESCRIPTION:
 I.   Problem Description:  (General)
 WIN-OS/2 is failing to launch if there is no mouse type
 specified in MOUSE.INI
 .
 II   Technical Description
 When starting any WIN-OS/2 session(FS or Seamless), the session
 will terminate before it starts. If initiated from an ICON, it
 will hatch then unhatch. If initiated from a command line,
 "Loading Please Wait..." will appear, then the session prompt
 will re-display. If starting a WIN-OS/2 session from a command
 line with a "/B" switch, the BOOTLOG.TXT file will show
 LOADSTART=MOUSE.DRV as the last statement in the file. A look
 at MOUSE.INI reveals "MOUSETYPE=". That statement MUST equal
 the type of hardware installed on the system. When running in
 DOS/WINDOWS, the system will query the hardware attached and
 update MOUSE.INI accordingly. This is not occurring in OS/2.
 .
 .
 VII. APAR Screening Information:
 .
       1.  Has the problem been recreated in Boca?  YES
       2.  What configuration / settings changes were
           tried? Edited MOUSE.INI to have the statement
           = nothing. The statement is appearing in this form
           among mamy users all with the same symptoms.
       3.  Does the problem occur in DOS / Windows? NO.
    DOS/WINDOWS updates MOUSE.INI when Windows is
           launched
 .

 .
 VIII. APAR creation approved by: NG

 LOCAL FIX:
 If MouseType= is set to the type of mouse installed on the
 system

<img align=right hspace=20 src="mass1.gif">
<B>Massachusetts and Canada have been trading for a long time.</B>
Massachusetts and Canada have had a mutually profitable exchange
for almost three centuries. Fish and lumber are still important
staples of the trade, but sophisticated electronics now form the
heart of the exchange. In 1993 two-way merchandise trade reached
$5.46 billion, an increase of 14% since 1989. Massachusetts sold
$2.26 billion and bought $3.20 billion in goods from Canada.  <br clear=all>
<P>
<img align=right hspace=20 src="mass2.gif">
<B>From computers and semi-conductors...</B>Massachusetts'
high-tech electronics industries sold Canada almost a billion
dollars worth of equipment in 1993, suppporting thousands of highly
skilled jobs in the Bay State. Sales of computers totalled $683
million; tubes and semi-conductors, $114 million;
telecommunications equipment, $85 million; and televisions, radios
and stereos, $2 million. <P>

Canada bought $229 million worth of personal and household goods from Massachusetts's companies, including $35 million worth of books and other printed material, $47 million worth of photographic equipment and $18 million worth of sporting goods.
<p>
<h3>Canada supplies Massachusetts' electronics industry...</h3>
Canada provided vital components and finished products in 1993, including $585 million worth of office machines, $72 million worth of telecommunications equipment and $24 million worth of audio and visual equipment.
<p>
<h3>Homebuilders and publishers...</h3>
Canada's mills provided Massachusetts with $248 millio worth of lumber and other wood and $361 million worth of pulp and paper.
<p>
<h3>And processors and consumers.</h3>
Canada sold Massachusetts $548 million worth of fresh, frozen and canned fish and another $159 million of agricultural products.
<p>
<h3>Tourism and other services contribute much more.</h3>
The exchange of services, including travel, banking fees, computer software, and financial, professional and other expertise, brought billions of dollars to the economies of Massachusetts and Canada in 1993.  Tourism alone brought in $259 million; 491,000 visitors from Canada travelled to Masssachusetts and spent more than $129 million, while 419,000 residents of Massachusetts spent $130 million in Canada.
<p><img align=right hspace=20 src="mass3.gif">
<h3>Massachusetts' leading Canadian trading partner is Ontario.</h3>
In 1993, the state's two-way trade with Ontario, Canada's largest province, was greater than its trade with the other nine provinces combined. <br clear=all>

<P>Pharmacy practice research is analogous to health services research and may be defined as "the
study
of the rationale, scope, efficiency and effectiveness of pharmacy practice".  It is multidisciplinary

     One recommendation from The Research Methods Workshop was the development of a
     infrastructure for Pharmacy Practice research in Canada.  CPhA is currently developing a
     framework for the implementation and administration of such an organization.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Development of a standardized list of pharmacist interventions and services
     CPhA is starting to work on a standardized list of pharmacist interventions and services that
     can be used to document pharmacists workload.
<BR><BR>
<LI> Development of a "relative value scale" for the pharmacists' interventions and services
     Once the standardized list of pharmacist interventions and services has been completed, CPhA
     will conduct a series of surveys that will determine the relative value of  these professional
     services of pharmacists.  Once this scale has been developed, it can be used as a basis for
     negotiation of renumeration for cognitive services.

OS/2 hangs after installation
</title>
<h2>
OS/2 hangs after installation
</h2>
Last Updated: 27th November, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Following installation, OS/2 displays the new logo screen and
   hangs.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   Any.

<h2>Problem</h2>

   IRQ conflict.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   Ensure that no two adapters share an IRQ setting.  To help
   determine which driver is being loaded at the time of the hang (and
   thus which adapter may be a part of the problem ), re-boot and
   press Alt-F2 when the "boot-blob" (small white rectangle in the
   upper left corner of the screen) appears. This will list each
   driver as it loads.

<h2>Notes</h2>

   If the hang occurs later in the boot process, try adding /V
   parameters to various drivers; this may yield additional
   information about which drivers are or are not operating as
   expected.

<h1>FAST FACTS ON CANADA</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>ENTRY INTO CANADA</h2><p>

 Citizens or permanent  residents of the United  States (U.S.) do  not require   visas or passports to visit Canada. Passports are  recommended as they verify   citizenship. Where a current passport is not available, U.S. citizens should   carry identification papers (originals or certified true copies only) showing   their  citizenship,  such as,  birth,  baptismal,  naturalization or  voter's   certificates  plus  one identification  card  containing  a photo.  Permanent   residens of  the U.S. are  advised to  carry their Resident  Alien Card  (US.   Forrn  1-151 or  Form 1-551). Further  information can  be obtained  from the  Canadian Embassy and Consulates.<p>  

<h2>CURRENCY</h2><p>

   Money  in Canada is in dollars  and cents, as in the  U.S. Because of current   monetary exchange rates, there may  be a difference in value between  the two   currencies. Although American money  is usually accepted in  Canada, visitors   should  exchange their funds (or traveller's cheques) for Canadian dollars
at   any Canadian  financial institution  where they will  receive the  prevailing   rate  of  exchange.  Less  favourable  rates  of exchange  may  be  given 
by   commercial establishments.<p>

 <h2>CREDIT CARDS</h2><p>

   Most American credit cards are honoured in Canada. Most U.S. ATM cards can
be   used in Canada. Money will  be disbursed in Canadian funds, and  converted
to   U.S. dollars on bank statement.<p>

<h2>TELEPHONE</h2><p>

   Most U.S. calling cards are compatible with Canada's phone systems.<p>

 <h2>TIPPING</h2><p>

   Tips  or service  charges are  not  usually added  to a  bill  in Canada. 
In   general,  a tip of  up to 15% of  the total amount is  given. This applies
to   waiters, waitresses, barbers and hairdressers,  taxi drivers, etc.  Bellhops,   doormen, redcaps (porters) etc., at hotels, airports, and railway stations are   generally paid $1 per item of luggage.<p>

<h2>HEALTH INSURANCE</h2><p>

   Canadian  hospital and medical services are excellent. It is recommended that   visitors to Canada obtain traveller's  health insurance before leaving  their   country  because health  insurance  plans often  do  not extend  coverage  for   services  received outside the country  of residence. Visitors  may find they   have  either no  health  insurance or  inadequate  coverage when  in  Canada.   Visitors taking  medicine prescribed by a  doctor should bring a  copy of the   prescription in case it needs to be renewed by a doctor in Canada.<p>   

 <h2>EMERGENCY</h2><p>      Dial "O" for the operator and ask for the police, who are trained    and  equipped   to  handle  and  coordinate  emergency   services.  In  some   municipalities, a 911 emergency service exists.<p>

 <h2>METRIC CONVERSION</h2><p>

Canada uses the metric system. Visitors will find weather temperature reports given  in  degrees Celsius,  gasoline sold  by  the litre  (milk and  wine
by   millilitres and litres), grocery items in grams and kilograms, clothing sizes   in centimetres, fabric lengths in metres and road speeds posted in kilometres   per hour.<p>   
<center>
                      1 U.S. gallon = 3.78 litres<br>
                      1 mile = 1.6 kilometers
</center>
<p>

<h2>CLIMATE</h2><p>   

Local  weather  conditions  vary considerably  due  to  Canada's large  size.   However,  daily and  extended weather  forecasts  are readily  available from   radio and television stations and newspapers. In summer, hotels, restaurants,   theatres,  cinemas and stores are air-conditioned. In winter, all private and   public buildings, railway stations and bus terminals are heated, and all main   highways are cleared of snow.   Although  days in summer are warm, evenings may   be  cool, and  visitors planning  fishing, camping  or canoeing  trips should   bring medium-and heavier-weight apparel  in addition to summer  clothing. The   temperature is reported in degrees Celsius.<p>   <h2>TIME</h2><p>
   Standard time zones observed during winter months. Canada spans six time   zones:    All times zones are plus/minus Eastern Sundard Time)<p>   
<ul type=square>
  <li>>Newfoundland Standard Time:      +1.5 hours<br>
   <li>>Atlantic Standard Time:                 +1 hour<br>
  <li>>Eastern Standard Time<br>
  <li>>Central Standard Time:                   -1 hour<br>
  <li>>Mountain Standard Time:               -2 hours<br>
  <li>>Pacific Standard Time:                    -3 hours<p>
</ul>>


<h3>Daylight Saving Time</H3><p>

Each year,  on the first  Sunday in  April, Daylight Saving  Time comes  into   effect in most  of Canada and  clocks are advanced by  one hour. On the  last   Sunday in October, Canada reverts to Standard Time.<p>

<h2>DRIVERS' LICENSES</h2><p>
   American  state driver's licenses are valid in  Canada for varying periods
of   time  as  legislated  by  individual  provinces  and  territories.  The  1949   International Driving Permit is also valid but it must be  accompanied at all   times by the visitor's state or national driver's license.<p> 

<h2>RADAR DETECTION DEVICES</h2><p>
   The  possession  and use  of  radar  detection  devices is  illegal  in  most   provinces.  It  is suggested  that units  be  rendered inoperable  and placed   inside a piece of luggage when travelling in Canada.<p>

<h2>CUSTOMS</h2><p>
Import allowances:  
<ol type=a> 
<li>>200 cigarettes  and 50  cigars, and  11cg. (2.2  Ib)   tobacco;<br> 
<li>>1 bottle  1.14 litre (40 imp. oz)  of liquor or 24 x 355  mL (12   oz) bottles  or tins (8.5 litres)  of beer or  ale per person (18  yrs of age   entering Alberta,  Manitoba, Quebec), (19 yrs  of age in  all other provinces   and territories);<br>
<li>>small amount of  perfume for  personal use;<br>
<li>>gifts free of duties to the value of $60.00 (Canadian) per gift.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>FIREARMS</h2><p>
All firearms must be declared to Canada  Customs at the first point of entry.   Otherwise, Customs will seize undeclared firearms and criminal charges may
be laid.<p>   
<h2>BUSINESS TRIPS, CONVENTIONS AND MEETINGS</h2><p>   
   Canada Customs  has  a  special program  called  "The  Foreign  Organizations Remission Order" to meet the needs of U.S. organizations holding meetings
in   Canada. To obtain  a copy of the <a href="http:/www.nstn.ca/wshdc/customs.html"> &quot;Welcome to Canada:  A Guide to Canada Customs for Meetings,  Conventions,  Trade  Shows  &amp;  Exhibitions&quot;</a>, contact  the  Canadian Embassy or Consulate nearest you.<p>  
<a href="convene.html">Select here for information on convention and meeting sites in Canadian cities.</a>
<p>

<h2>SHIPPING TO CANADA</h2><p>   
Canadian customs brokers or  a Canada Customs office can  provide information   on transportation companies that offer efficient service for &quot;time-sensitive&quot;   meeting materials or exhibit goods.<p> 

<h2>GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (GST) AND VISITOR REBATES</h2><p>
   The Goods and  Services Tax (GST)  is a seven  per cent  tax charged on  most   goods and services sold or  provided in Canada. As  a visitor to Canada,  you   will pay the tax on most of your purchasea. Under the   Visitor Rebate Program, you may get a refund of the tax you paid on goods you   take home and on short-term accommodation in Canada<p>
   <p>   Additional information and a refund application form may be found in the &quot;Tax   Refund  Application  for  Visitors&quot; pamphlet  available  at  Canada  Customs   offices, Canadian embassies and consulates, most tourism information centres,   participating Canadian Duty Free Shops and some hotels and retail stores.<p>

System stops booting because of problem with COUNTRY.SYS
</title>
<h2>
System stops booting because of problem with COUNTRY.SYS
</h2>
Last Updated: 27th November, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   During installation the following message appears:

   "The country information file A:\COUNTRY.SYS is incorrect.  The
   system is stopped.  Correct the preceding error and restart."

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   3.5" and 5.25" floppy drives

<h2>Problem</h2>

   CMOS not set up properly; it thought the 3.5" A:  drive was a 5.25"
   drive and that the 5.25" B:  drive was a 3.5" drive.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   Correct the CMOS settings.

<h2>Notes</h2>

   This could happen as the result of a bad CMOS battery, or from
   swapping the diskette drive cables and forgetting to re-set the
   CMOS information to match the change.

<BR>
<P>
Advocacy is one of the key functions of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Assocation.  By
monitoring
and maintaining close contacts with governments, media and parliamentary committees, CPhA
ensures that the pharmacist's voice is heard. When issues of concern to pharmacists and their patients arise, CPhA takes the lead,
ensuring those concerns are brought to the attention of the appropriate government department. 
CPhA has successfully promoted the views of pharmacists on a number of issues.  The
association 
is also an active member of many health care coalitions.

<p>
Canada is the easiest destination in the world to add that &quot;international  flavour&quot; to
your meeting. Delegates to  Canada will enjoy a uniquely foreign and friendly
experience - exotic yet  familiar - a close  and safe, but still exciting, destination.
With over 5,000 hotels, resorts  conference and convention centres Canada has
the range of   facilities and services necessary to make your meeting successful.   
This handy guide provides you with information to ensure  fast, efficient, and 
friendly customs services, particularly when bringing convention or meeting
materials and equipment into Canada.  Canada Customs  has introduced  special
measures to allow promotional printed matter, awards, and souvenirs, as well as
sophisticated office machinery, and displays to be brought in duty-free and non-
taxable.<p>
<p>
When planning a meeting, convention, trade show or exhibition to  Canada,
consider consulting one of Canada's Business Travel Specialists located across the
United States. They will be delighted to introduce you to the very best that Canada
has to offer... in People, Places and  Savoir-Faire.
<p>
<a name = "Regulations"><h3>Customs Regulations</h3></a>
<p>
<h4>How they affect you</H4>
<p>
The following explanation of Canada  Customs regulations applies to meetings or
conventions held in Canada by foreign organizations that involve mostly foreign
delegates. Meeting or convention  planners who are well-informed about Canada
Customs regulations will have no problems with their  Canadian event. 
           <p>
Streamlined policies and procedures now allow experienced
 organizers of   meetings, trade shows  and conventions to meet the Canada
Customs requirements  for bringing  their events to Canada with advice  from 
Canada Customs  Exhibitions Unit officers. However, many meeting or convention
planners prefer to hire customs brokers because they provide extras such as
special forms, information on which Canada Customs office you should apply to,
and counselling on how your meeting or convention might be affected by Canada
Customs regulations. Customs brokers can spend time with you to anticipate any
needs and avert any problems.<p>
<p>
As only a  few customs brokers specialize in meetings, conventions, and trade
shows, you should obtain a list of  customs brokers specializing  in these areas  by
contacting:
<p>
<OL type=i>
<Li>The Convention and Visitors Bureau of  your host city; <br>
<Li>The  facility where your event is being held; or  <br>
<Li>The nearest Canadian Embassy,   Canadian Consulate General  or Canadian 
Government Trade Office.  <p>
</OL>
<p>
<a name = "Procedures"><h3>Procedures</h3></a>
<p>

<h4>Advance Notice of Intention to  Hold a Meeting</H4>
<p>
It is important to provide sufficient advance notice to Canada Customs when
arranging your meeting or convention in Canada.<p>
At least six months is recommended for corporate meetings and conventions. For
large association meetings, with an exhibition component, one year is the
suggested lead time.<p>
<p>
<h4>Identification of Designated Representative</H4>
<p>
For Canada Customs purposes, you must identify who will be responsible for
processing the necessary customs documents through the local Canada Customs
Office as the goods arrive. This may be either your customs broker, an employee of
your organization or another representative.  If you hire a customs broker, he or
she will prepare all of the documentation necessary for complying with Canada
Customs requirements; A customs broker will also act as your designated
representative-when your goods arrive in Canada, thus saving you or your
employees from having to personally clear the shipments.
<p>
If you choose to hire a representative other than a customs broker to handle your
Canada Customs clearance, this representative must handle these responsibilities
on a casual basis only, and cannot be paid for this work. This restriction, of course,
does not apply to an employee of your own organization who had been designated
this responsibility. <p>
<p>
<h4>Announcement to Canada Customs</H4>
<p>
To accomplish both of the above objectives it is necessary to forward a letter,
announcing your intention to hold a meeting, to the local Canada Customs office.    
          <p>
<h4>Confirmation by Canada Customs</H4>
<p>
Canada Customs will reply by letter, advising you  of the procedures that will apply
to your event.  Make sure that you or your customs broker have a copy of this
letter when your goods are cleared. If  you have any questions, or  your plans
change, contact Canada Customs and/or your customs broker immediately.
<p>
<a name = "General"><h3>General Information</h3></a>
<p>
    To make it easier for meeting and convention planners, Canada has streamlined
many of its customs and immigration procedures. Special provisions for bringing in
goods for meetings and conventions may fall under the "Foreign Organizations
Remission Order" or under Classification Number 9819.00.00.00, which provides
for goods brought in for display at a convention or public exhibition. 
<p>
<h4>Duty Free and Non-Taxable Importation</H4>
<p>
Although we refer to duty-free as non-taxable importation, in most cases, a
security deposit will be required by Canada Customs (certified bonds are
acceptable), to ensure re-export of the goods from Canada.
<p>
Special regulations apply to exhibits. Suppliers' goods that will
 be exhibited at a convention are  admitted temporarily with a security deposit. A
customs broker will usually post the security deposit on your behalf in the form of
a cheque or bond. Canada Customs and/or your customs broker will require a list
of exhibitors (including name of contact, address, telephone number), a booth
number, a floor plan, a copy of your prospectus, and a copy of your exhibitor
manual.
<p>
<h4>Meeting and Convention Materials, Souvenirs, etc.</H4>
<p>
Even though meeting and convention materials imported for your event must still
be reported, these can now be brought in without the payment of duty or taxes.
The same rule applies to souvenirs, and these must be distributed free of charge.
The value of these souvenirs, giveaways, or any other advertising materials must
not exceed $25 (Canadian) each. 
<p>
<h4>Souvenirs Exceeding $25 (Canadian)</H4>
<p>
Souvenirs valued at more than $5 must bear some identifying mark tat refers
specifically to the meeting or convention taking place in Canada. special
arrangements or these items must be male in advance. Any goods left over must
be re-exported at the end of the convention or they will Be subject to the duty and
taxes normally payable.<p>

<h4>Quantities for Free Distribution</H4>
<p>
The number of items for free distribution should match the
anticipated number of delegates and should be listed on invoices
when accounting for the goods at Canada Customs. State the name of
the organization, country of origin, a description of the goods,
the quantity and the value.<p>
<p>
<h4>Office Machines and Audio Visual Equipment</H4>
<p>
Office machines and audio-visual equipment imported by a foreign
organization used exclusively at  the meeting or convention, and
exported at its conclusion, qualify for temporary importation
privileges.  A bond or a refundable security deposit will usually
be required.<p>
<p>
<h4>Official Paraphernalia for  Fund-Raising</H4>
<p>
Official paraphernalia bearing the registered insignia of a foreign
organization will be allowed temporarily into Canada to permit them
to be sold to delegates as a fund-raising project.<p>
<p>
<h4>Shipping to Canada</H4>
<p>
Canadian customs brokers or a Canada customs  office can provide
information on transportation companies that offer efficient
service for time-sensitive meeting materials or exhibit goods.<p>
<p>
<h4>Delegates' Personal Baggage</H4>
<p>
Goods for personal use, including clothing, cameras, tape
recorders, personal computers, and limited  quantities of alcoholic
beverages and tobacco products (see note) are exempt from duty and
tax, provided they accompany the delegate and are declared to
Canada Customs upon entering Canada.<p>
<p>
Recently purchased items, such as cameras, tape recorders, or
personal computers should be registered with your own customs
service before leaving your country, to prove that they were
purchased before entering Canada.<p>
<p>
Note: Persons of legal age may bring in duty- free either:<p>

i) 1.1 liters (40 ounces) of liquor or wine; or<br>
ii) 24 x 355-ml (12-ounce) cans or bottles of beer or ale, or their
equivalent.  <p>
<p>
Persons 16 years or older may bring in, duty- free, 50 cigars, 200
cigarettes and 1 kg (2.2 pounds) of manufactured tobacco.  <p>
<p>
<h4>Guest Speakers</H4>
<p>
Guest speakers invited by a foreign organiation do not require work
permits from Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Guest speakers
 should meet immigration requirements applicable to visitors to
Canada. Guest speakers should carry a letter of introduction from
the convention organizers.<p>
<p>
<h4>Proof of Citizenship</H4>
<p>
All visitors must show proof of citizenship. Documents such as a
passport, birth certificate, or other form of proof of residence
are aaceptable. Citizens of countries other than the U.S. should
check with the Canadian Embassy, nearest Consulate, or Canadian
Government Trade Office before their departure.<p>
<p>
Administrative and Support Staff<p>
<p>
Stafmembers of foreign organizations are considered "visitors", and
do not require a work permit. They need only meet normal
immigration requirements as visitors to Canada.<p>
<p>

<p>
<a name = "Questions"><h3>Questions and Answers</h3></a>
<p>
<b>What are the advantages of hiring a Canadian customs broker?</b> <p>
<p>
Canadian customs brokers are licensed by Canada Customs. A customs
broker will help you in your communications and dealings with
Canada Customs. Customs brokers provide you with the documents you
need and can help you complete them. They will advise you of any
areas that could cause problems. Customs brokers can post bonds
with Canada Customs on your behalf. They can  also suggest the best
transportation route for your goods, and will be there to oversee
all shipments from origin to show site, including the move-in and
the move-out.<p>
<p>
<b>Can I use a courier service?</b><p>
<p>
Yes, but check to see if the courier is authorized   to deal with
Canada Customs on your behalf. Otherwise, when your goods arrive at
the Canada Customs point of entry, you must go to the Canada
Customs office and clear the goods yourself.<p>
<p>
<b>If a certain percentage of Canadian participants attend, how does
this affect the process?</b><p>
<p>
Duty charged on paraphernalia sold or on any souvenirs valued at
more than $25 (Canadian) will be pro-rated to the percentage of
Canadian participants. <p>
<p>
<b>How does an organzer prove the nationality make-up of an event?</b><p>
<p>
Canada Customs will ask you for an estimate of the nationaility
make-up in some cases, however, they may ask to see the
registration cards completed by all delegates who attended your
event.<p>

<p>
<b>If I have to pay a security deposit, who pays it?</b><p>
<p>
You must do it yourself.  If you have a customs broker, the broker
can look after this for you.<p>
<p>
<b>What if I haven't used all the souvenirs I planned to?</b><p>
<p>
Check with your customs broker or your own customs service, before
leaving home, to determine conditions for bringing back unused
materials, souvenirs or displays.  For instance, U.S. customs
requires that all printed material brought back to the U.S. must
show on each separate time that it was printed or produced in the
U.S.  If not, it could be subject to U.S. duty.<p>

THE SWAPPER FILE IN WARP
</title>
<h3>
THE SWAPPER FILE IN WARP
</h3>
Last updated: 27 Dec 1994
<hr>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS</h3><pre>
    The swapper file is larger in WARP than in previous releases of
    OS2.

</pre><h3>SUMMARY OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    This is normal.

</pre><h3>DETAILS OF RESOLUTION</h3><pre>
    This is normal.
    The most significant change that has been made is how system DLL's
    get loaded and what is now valid data for swapping.
    System DLL's include:
    DISPLAY          SOM          PMMERGE      PMWP
    DOSCALL1         PMATM        PMMLE
    IBMDEV32         PMCTLS       PMSPL
    IBMVGA32         PMGPI        PMVIOP

    In the previous versions of OS/2, dll code was never copied to the
    swapper file.  In WARP, code for system dll's can be written to
    the swapper file and, in adition, during boot, PMMERGE, DOSCALL1,
    PMGPI, PMWP and PMVIOP will be swapped out.  This means that there
    will be an overall increase in swapper size.  This was done
    to increase overall system perfomance.

Various odd symptoms with PTI IDE drive
</title>
<h2>
Various odd symptoms with PTI IDE drive
</h2>
Last Updated: 27th November, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Unable to install, unable to access hard drive, intermittent and odd
   effects after installation (HPFS, possibly FAT as well).  One user
   reported the loss of pop-up menus (mouse RMB and Shift-F10)
   persisting even over a power-down and a MAKEINI rebuild of both
   OS/2 INI files.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   Promise Technology, Inc.  DC4030VL-2 4-drive IDE adapter and
   PTI1S506.ADD driver.

<h2>Problem</h2>

   It appears that there are problems with the PTI driver, at least
   with v1.2.3, v1.3, and v1.40.  PTI Tech Support has said that there
   are problems related to the PTI driver writing to the OS/2 boot
   partition at shutdown, which is assumed to be FAT.

<h2>Fixes</h2>

   Install to a FAT partition.  Or, Use the IBM1S506.ADD driver
   shipped with Warp by removing the PTI1S506.ADD line from CONFIG.SYS
   and adding the following line in its place (assuming 2 drives):
<p>
   BASEDEV=IBM1S506.ADD /A:0 /U:0 /!SMS /U:1 /!SMS

<h2>Notes</h2>

   Writing to an OS/2 HPFS partition as if it were a FAT partition is
   not generally recommended.

Unable to create OS/2 bootable partition
</title>
<h2>
Unable to create OS/2 bootable partition
</h2>
Last Updated: 27th November, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Unable to successfully create an OS/2 bootable partition.
   Unable to allocate a FAT partition.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   "Large" drive with more than 1024 cylinders (e.g. most
   drives larger than 500 Mb).

<h2>Problem</h2>

   DOS and the "IBM PC Compatible" BIOS routines are unable to address
   a cylinder address greater than 1023 without some assistance. The
   resulting "FAT Barrier" forces some restrictions on DOS, OS/2, and
   any operating system which uses the BIOS suport for any part of its
   boot process. For the purposes of OS/2 Warp installation, these
   are:
<p>
   Boot Manager's partition must reside within the "FAT Barrier", that
   is, below cylinder 1024.
<p>
   DOS and OS/2 bootable partitions, whether FAT or HPFS, must also
   reside completely within the FAT barrier.
<p>
   DOS-compatible FAT partitions must reside completely within the FAT
   barrier (no surprise).
<p>
   OS/2 non-bootable HPFS partitions can go anywhere and be any size
   up to the OS/2 limit of 512 Gb.


<h2>Fix</h2>

   Some general rules of thumb may help your planning if you just
   picked up one of the new 540 Mb (or even 1 Gb) drives.
<p>
   Allocate Boot Manager as the first partition (lowest address) on
   the drive.
<p>
   Next, if desired, allocate a DOS boot partition (possibly with
   space for MSWin as well).
<p>
   If desired, and if the DOS boot partition is relatively small, add
   a second FAT partition for use by DOS and MSWin when RealDOS
   (PC-DOS or MS-DOS) is booted.
<p>
   Allocate your OS/2 Warp boot partition, either as FAT or HPFS.
<p>
   All of the above must fit within the "FAT Barrier".
<p>
   Finally, allocate the rest of the drive, however large, as one HPFS
   partition.

<h2>Notes</h2>

   Certain drives and adapters help move the FAT Barrier up above 500
   Mb by making it appear to the BIOS (or the adapter) that a
   "cylinder" contains more data than the physical drive geometry
   actually uses.  Thus, 1024 cylinders "contains" more disk space.
<p>
   If the drive performs the translation, it should be transparent to
   the BIOS, DOS, and OS/2.  If the adapter chipset performs the
   translation, the same will hold true.  However, if the translation
   is performed by the adapter &lt;BIOS&gt;, problems can result unless the
   manufacturer also provides an OS/2 driver for the adapter or OS/2
   uses the (slow) IBMINT13.I13 driver to force all disk I/O through
   the adapter BIOS.
<p>
   There is an error in the Warp User's Guide on page 310.  It states
   that "Typically, the first 1024 cylinders is equal to 1 GB
   (gigabyte), or 1024 Mb."  More frequently, 1024 cylinders is 512 Mb
   or so, but it all depends on the drive manufacturer.  I believe
   that the statement in question was the result of a mis-condensation
   of a comment made in the OS/2 v2.0 Control Program manual referring
   to &lt;IBM&gt; drives; in any case it is incorrect.

<H2>Why Enter the "Net"?</H2>
<HR><BODY><P>
Learning how to use the Internet can be an overwhelming experience. With the right tools and information you can benefit from using this global information network.  
<BR><BR>
The Internet provides an opportunity for you to communicate with other people around the world. Unlike the printed word which is static, the Internet is a dynamic technology which uses text, images, sound, animation and video.<BR><BR>

We believe the Internet can also be an effective way of informing other health care providers, government and the public about the valuable contribution pharmacists make to Canada's health care system. Our commitment to being part of the Internet includes providing you with a way to communicate with CPhA via our electronic mail address and through our home page.
<BR>
As a busy health care provider, you may not always have the time to browse the "Net" to search for the most up-to-date health or pharmaceutical information. To get you started, CPhA has developed this "How to Internet" guide tailored to your needs. Not only will we help demystify the technology, we will also outline how you can benefit from using the Internet as an essential health provider and drug therapy expert.

<H2>1995 Award for<br>
Canadian-American Business Achievement
<br>
Won by Automotive Industry Duo
</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR>
The first annual &quot;Award for Canadian-American Business Achievement&quot; has been awarded to two automotive parts firms for their innovative development of a business alliance between the U.S. and Canada.
<P>
<B>UAP Inc.</B> of Montreal, Quebec and <B>Genuine Parts Company</B> of Atlanta, Georgia received the award on June 8, 1995 from Canadian Ambassador Raymond Chr&eacute;tien at a black-tie affair gala at the Canadian Embassy.  Accepting the award were Jean
 Douville, CEO and Chairman of UAP and Larry Prince, CEO and Chairman of Genuine Parts Company.  The presentation, which took place in the Embassy theater, was comprised of speeches by the Ambassador; Frederick Stocker, President of the Foundation for Can
adian-American Business Achievement (FCABA); Jay Jaiswal, CEO and President of the founding sponsor organization, FHS International Inc.; and Peter Jost, President of the Canadian-American Business Council.

Ambassador Chr&eacute;tien, with Frederick Stocker,<br>
 presenting the Award to Jean Douville, UAP Inc. and Larry Prince, Genuine Parts Co.
</font>
</center>
<p>
The UAP and Genuine Parts alliance represents a true partnerhship in the best sense of the word.  In 1989, recognizing the opportunities brought by the North American Free Trade Agreement, the two companies formed the UAP/NAPA Automotive Western Partnersh
ip, with UAP Inc. as the managing partner.  The alliance was formed to develop the Western Canadian market, while simultaneously enabling both companies to share market expertise to the benefit of their respective home markets.  Their teamwork inspired a 
number of innovations in the automotive aftermarkets of both countries, including the creation of private brand products in Canada, a market first.  The products have been backed by special consumer warrantees and dealer programs that have resulted in dra
matic growth, including human resource growth of 1900 to 440, while profits have increased 96 percent over the last three years.  The entire process was so successful, it is now being replicated in Mexico.
<P>
&quot;We are thrilled to have received a nomination for this alliance that so well met the Foundation's criteria in the inaugural year of this Award,&quot; said Frederick Stokcer, President of the FCABA.  &quot;The UAP and Genuine Parts project reflects t
he innovation, commitment and creativity the Foundation and its partners want to promote.  These winners establish a precedent for our Foundation that will serve as a standard for years to come.&quot;
<P>
An honourable mention was given to Visual Edge Software of Montreal and Hewlett-Packard of Fort Collins, Colorado.  Russell Ure of Visual Edge accepted a plaque at the June 8 ceremony on behalf of both firms.  The Workstation group at Hewlett Packard adop
ted Visual Edge's marketing strategy, while helping Visual Edge refine its approach and prepare for the worldwide market.  The sophisticated quality control systems Hewlett-Packard helped Visual Edge establish are still in use today.  The success of the r
elationship enabled Visual Edge to concentrate on research and development, while Hewlett-Packard focused on worldwide marketing and sales of their value-added product.
<P>
The Award winners were chosen by a prestigious bi-national panel of 7 judges.  The selection criteria include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>introduction of innovative products, technologies and/or services;<br>
<LI>innovative use of current technologies or resources;<br>
<LI>impact on the marketplace;<br>
<LI>successfully overcoming obstacles or barriers; and<br>
<LI>sustained growth and profitability over a three-year period.
</UL>
<P>
The deadline for nominations for the 1996 Award is March 1, 1996.  Nomination forms will be available this autumn.  Inquiries about the Award should be directed to<I> Ellen Maidman, Executive Director of the Canadian-American Business Council</I> at<b> (2

<H2>What is the Internet?</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The Internet is a global network of linked computers which enables people around the world to share services and information.  The Internet was established in 1969, as a research tool for the US military. It has since evolved into a valuable resource for corporations, educational institutions and the public. Approximately 30 million people use the Internet, with the number growing daily.  
<BR><BR>
Benefits to Using the Internet:<BR>
<UL><LI><B>Internet e-mail</B>:  to communicate with others around the world
<BR>
<LI><B>Research Tool</B>:  to search and retrieve information
<BR>
<LI><B>Discussion Groups</B>:  to share information with others around the world on topics of interest to you 
<BR>
<LI><B>Electronic publishing</B>:   to disseminate newsletters, brochures and publications to other Internet users
</UL>
The Internet has experienced an explosion of health information. Although many sites supply useful, referenced material, there is an equal amount of unregulated data. Patients and health professionals alike are being offered everything from advice about diseases to discussion groups where they can exchange symptoms and tips on specific health concerns. 
<BR><BR>
The health information you and your patients obtain from the Internet may contain flaws or inconsistencies. To minimize the possibility of accessing inaccurate information, limit your search to pages developed from reputable sources (universities, government agencies and health professionals).  
<BR><BR>
<H4>GLOSSARY OF TERMS</H4>

<B>FAQ</B>:  acronym for frequently asked questions. Usually a document that lists answers to the most common questions on particular subjects.
<BR><BR>
<B>FTP</B>: a common method of accessing another Internet site to retrieve and/or send files.
<BR><BR>
<B>Newbie</B>:  a new user on the Internet.
<BR><BR>
<B>News Readers</B>: software used to read usenet newsgroups. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Usenet</B>: a world-wide system of  discussion groups. The Internet has over 10,000 discussion areas on different topics.
<BR><BR>
<B>TCP/IP</B>: transmission control protocol/Internet protocol is a universal standard piece of software that allows different computer systems to communicate with one another.</P>

<h2>
Installation of Warp fails with SYS3175 typically around diskette 1
</h2>
Last Updated: 5th December, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>

   Warp installation fails on a SYS3175 (access violation exception),
   typically (but not always) around Diskette 1.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

   System board with external cache (e.g.  most of today's 386, 486,
   and Pentium system boards).

<h2>Problem</h2>

   Some system boards' external cache logic have intermittent cache
   coherency problems due to poor design.  These tend to show up
   sooner and more frequently under OS/2 because of its heavy use of
   32-bit-wide RAM access.

<h2>Workaround</h2>
   Turn off the external cache using the system board's CMOS Setup
   program and restart the installation.

<h2>Notes</h2>

   None.

<H2>What is the World Wide Web?</H2>
<HR><P>
The World Wide Web (WWW) represents the "multimedia" part of the Internet.  It  incorporates text, images, sound, animation and video. The WWW is an interactive two-way communications channel, unlike the printed medium.
<BR><BR>
The WWW is made up of web sites or home pages from around the world.  Each site has a separate address or URL and can be accessed using software, known as a browser or web browser.
<BR><BR>
With a web browser, you can access any information on the Internet.  You simply point and click your computer mouse on a hyperlink and you are instantly brought to the information you requested.  
<BR><BR>
Hyperlinks enable you to move seamlessly from one part of a home page to another or from one site to another.  The process is similar to using an index or card catalogue to look up a book in a library. 
<BR><BR>
You can access a web site by either typing in the URL address in the location box at the top of the browser screen or by using a number of online search tools.  Once you access a web site that is of interest to you, it can be electronically bookmarked and saved to memory for future use. 
<BR><BR>
<H4>GLOSSARY OF TERMS</H4>
<B>Browser</B>:  a software program often referred to as a Web browser.  Browsers enable users to access both text, sounds and graphics. Netscape Navigator is one of the most popular browsers.
<BR><BR>
<B>Home page</B>: the first page or "welcome" screen  introducing a company's products and services.
<BR><BR>
<B>Http</B>: Hypertext transport protocol is the standard that enables information to be distributed across the WWW.
<BR><BR>
<B>Hyperlink</B>: Links are presented on the WWW  as underlined or coloured words, buttons, graphics or images.
<BR><BR>
<B>URL</B>: refers to Uniform Resource Locator, which is a computer address that identifies the location of a home page on the WWW.

Performance - Warp boot seems to take longer than expected

<h2>
Performance - Warp boot seems to take longer than expected
</h2>
Last Updated: 5th December, 1994
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
   Warp bootup seems to take much longer than expected, with much more
   disk activity.
<h2>Hardware</h2>
   Any.
<h2>Problem</h2>

   WPS Desktop Settings notebook accidentally left enabled.  This
   results in the entire WPS desktop being archived each time Warp is
   booted before the user gets control.  This can easily add several
   minutes to the boot process.

<h2>Fix</h2>

   Open the Desktop Settings notebook to the index tab marked Archive
   and un-check the box marked "Create archive at each system
   restart".

<h2>Notes</h2>

   In general, you shold only make archival copies of the Desktop
   after making large changes to it or at reasonable intervals (say
   every few days).

<BODY>
<H2>What do I Need to Access the Internet?</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The Internet is very easy to use provided you have all the necessary tools.  If you have a 386 computer, a 14,400 or 28,800 speed modem, appropriate communication software, a telephone line and an account with an Internet provider, you can access the Internet.  Before choosing an Internet provider, you may wish to use the checklist below.
<BR><BR>
<img src= "http://www.cdnpharm.ca/chbox.gif"><B>Research Internet providers in your area</B>:  Make sure you do some research before signing on with an Internet provider. Choose one that has been in business for a long time and offers the kind of service you need. You can find lists of providers in computer magazines or flyers available free in your community or in the telephone book's yellow pages.
<BR><BR>
<img src= "http://www.cdnpharm.ca/chbox.gif"><B>Contact a few providers to inquire about the costs of a dial-up access account</B>:  It is important to shop around because providers do not all offer the same type of accounts or level of customer service.  Some charge a set- up fee in addition to the account rate, a few offer 24-hour customer service, others are available only during regular business hours.  Be careful about hidden charges.
<BR><BR>
<img src= "http://www.cdnpharm.ca/chbox.gif"><B>Don't buy more online time than you need</B>:  Most providers offer different account levels depending on the amount of time per month you plan on using the Internet.  First time users generally sign up for 15 hours per month. You may require 50 hours a month if you intend on using the Internet regularly. 
<BR><BR>
<img src= "http://www.cdnpharm.ca/chbox.gif"><B>What communication software is provided with your account</B>: Many providers offer the necessary software to access the Internet. As a minimum you will need TCP/IP software to connect by modem to your Internet provider, software for e-mail, a browser for "surfing" the WWW, a newsgroup reader and FTP to transfer files to your computer.  Ask if the provider can supply complete documentation or instructions to install and use the software.
<BR><BR>
<img src= "http://www.cdnpharm.ca/chbox.gif"><B>Pick an Internet provider that meets your needs and go online</B>:  Once you have done the research, contact the provider of your choice and inquire about setting up an account.  Before you sign on, ask the provider if the software with the account is preconfigured to support your computer system (Windows, Macintosh, Unix etc.). Now you are all set to experience the Internet!

<H2>How Do I Use E-mail?</H2>
<HR>
<P>The most common use of the Internet is electronic mail. Once you learn to use e-mail, you will find it a faster and less expensive way of communicating with others.  It is more efficient and less costly than faxing or regular mail. Regardless of where the e-mail is sent, the only cost to you is the fee for your Internet account. 
<BR><BR>
There are many different Internet e-mail software products available.  The principles of how they work are the same. 
<BR><BR>
<H4>Communicating via e-mail</H4>
E-mail messages are sent using Internet e-mail software on your computer. You  key in the e-mail address of the person to whom you are sending mail to in addition to your message. Internet e- mail also enables you to attach word processing documents or graphic files. 
<BR><BR>
Once you click on the send button, your message is sent through to the recipient's e-mail address on the Internet via your Internet provider.
<BR><BR>
The recipient then retrieves his/her e-mail messages from the Internet via his/her Internet provider and replies, forwards or stores your e-mail. 
<BR><BR>
<H4>Glossary of Terms</H4>
<B>Configuration</B>: setting up your e-mail software so it can communicate with your Internet provider.
<BR><BR>
<B>E-mail</B>: abbreviation for "electronic" mail.  It allows a person to send and receive messages almost instantly from anywhere in the world via computer and modem. 
<BR><BR>
<B>Eudora Pro</B>: one of the best e-mail software applications for sending and receiving e-mail.
<BR><BR>
<B>MIME</B>: Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions;  a standard way for mail to format information  so that it can be sent as a file attachment.
<BR><BR>
<B>POP 3</B>: Post Office Protocol; the name of your Internet providers's server (a computer component) that handles incoming and outgoing mail for your account.</P>

<title>Optimising Performance Using The SWAPPATH Statement</title>
<h2>Optimising Performance Using The SWAPPATH Statement</h2>
Last Updated: 13th January, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
After installation Warp runs slowly, or is unstable. 
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
The default swapfile in Warp is 2 meg, too small for most systems. If the swapfile
grows over discontiguous areas of the hard drive, data transfer will be interrupted
by drive head movement. On some systems this seems to contribute to instability.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
Increase the size of the swapfile. For systems with 16 meg ram or less, try changing
the entry in config.sys to:
<p>
<pre>
    SWAPPATH=drive:\directory 2048 20480
</pre>
<p>
This will prebuild a 20 meg swapfile over a contiguous area of drive space.

<title>Optimising Windows Performance Under Warp</title>
<h2>Optimising Windows Performance Under Warp</h2>
Last Updated: 13th January, 1995
<hr>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>
Windows sessions operate slowly.
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>
The default WinOS/2 settings are suboptimal for many systems.
<p>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>
For best performance, change the following WinOS/2 settings for all windows
sessions:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Run applications in a full screen session.<br>
It takes extra system processing to remap the windows display to the OS/2
desktop.
<p>
<li>Set WIN_DDE off<br>
If you don't use DDE between OS/2 and WIndows programs, turning this off
will improve performance.
<p>
<li>Change DPMI_Memory_Limit to 16 or less.<br>
The default is 64 meg!<br>
<p>
<li>Set EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT to 0<br>
<li>Set XMS_MEMORY_LIMIT to 0<br>
<p>
<li>Set SESSION_PRIORITY to 2 or 3<br>
On many systems this improves mouse responsiveness.

<H2>How Do I Use Mailing Lists and Newsgroups?</H2>
<HR>
<P>
<H4>Mailing Lists</H4>

A mailing list is an e-mail address that distributes all mail sent to it back out to a list of addresses. It allows people to send e-mail to one address and copy and send the message to other subscribers of a mail list.  It also enables people with different kinds of e-mail access to participate in discussions together. 
<BR>
Mailing lists provide an opportunity to discuss topics with others who share your interests.  There exist thousands of mailing lists on the Internet on every topic imaginable. If you are interested in a particular topic, send an e-mail message to the mailing list with the message SUBSCRIBE  first name last name.  We have included some health-related mailing lists on the left side of this page.
<BR><BR>
<H4>Newsgroups</H4>

The WWW  is a great resource, but it is only one part of the Internet. Usenet newsgroups are a means of tapping into even more information.  A usenet newgroup is a place on the Internet where people with similar or dissimilar interests can come together to express their views and ask questions.  
<BR><BR>
Usenet is an  electronic bulletin board system with over 5000 discussion areas representing a wide variety of topics of interest. With newsreader software, you can keep up-to-date on the latest health information by reading and responding to messages from other health professionals on topics of interest to you.
<BR><BR>
Do you want to know how other pharmacists have been affected by managed care? Or do you want to discuss the latest drugs with pharmacists from around the world? Odds are you will find a newsgroup that fits your interest. 
<BR><BR>
<H4>MAILING LISTS AND NEWSGROUPS</H4>

<CENTER><H3>Approaches to Enhancing the Quality of Drug Therapy <BR>

A Joint Statement by the<BR>

Canadian Medical Association & the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association</H3></CENTER>

<BR>



<P>The Board of Directors of the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) & the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association (CPhA) and have approved a landmark document:  a joint statement on Approaches to Enhancing the Quality of Drug Therapy.  "We believe that the information contained in this statement will not only improve and foster better working relationships between the professions, but will improve health care for patients," says Bev Allen, CPhA President. "Physicians and pharmacists must support each other's relationship with patients and promote a collaborative approach to drug therapy," stated CMA President, Dr. Judith Kazimirski.  "This involves effective communication and the understanding of their complementary roles."<BR>

<BR>

<P><B>BACKGROUND</B>:  Recognizing the significant contribution pharmaceuticals make to health, both associations realize that patients, pharmacists and physicians must all work together to achieve optimal outcomes from drug therapy.  The associations feel that a national document outlining strategies to facilitate teamwork, as well as pharmacists' and physicians' responsibilities in drug therapy, would further enhance the quality of drug therapy.  As far as we are aware, this is the first document of its kind in the world.<BR>

<BR>

<P>This statement was produced by a working group of CPhA and CMA volunteers and staff.  CPhA's Board of Directors and Professional Affairs Committee were involved in reviewing drafts of the statement.  In January '96, the draft statement was sent for external consultation to national and provincial pharmacy and medical organizations and faculties, consumer groups, and  approximately 100 individual pharmacists.  The extensive feedback received helped refine the document, which was approved by CPhA and CMA Boards in May.<BR>

<BR>

<P><B>WHAT the STATEMENT IS</B>:  The statement outlines strategies to improve the quality of drug therapy and promote teamwork and communication among patients, pharmacists and physicians.  It recognizes the contribution pharmacists make to patient care and our responsibility to provide high quality drug therapy to achieve optimal patient outcomes.  It is hoped that this joint statement will provide physicians and pharmacists with a clear understanding of our complementary and supportive responsibilities.  Providing pharmaceutical care to our patients will only be achieved through such understanding and partnership.<BR>

<BR>



<P><B>WHAT the STATEMENT IS NOT</B>:  The statement is not intended to describe all aspects of pharmacists' or physicians' activities, nor is it intended to restrict or inhibit positive developments in medical or pharmacy practice.  The important contribution of all members of the health care team is recognized; however, the focus is on physicians and pharmacists.  To ensure its continuing applicability to pharmacy and medical practices, the statement will be reviewed and assessed regularly.<BR>

<BR>

<P><B>IMPACT ON PHARMACY</B>:  "This joint statement clearly marks the cooperative nature that is required for pharmaceutical care," says Ron Elliott, chair of CPhA's Professional Affairs Committee.  "I look forward to meeting with our local physicians to discuss the statement and identify opportunities to improve patient care in everyday practice."<BR>

<BR>

<P>In addition to the goal of providing optimal drug therapy to improve patients' quality of life, this statement provides a number of opportunities for our profession: <BR>

<UL>

 	<LI>a national document which recognizes the important roles of patients, pharmacists and physicians working in partnership to achieve optimal outcomes from drug therapy<BR>

<BR>

 	<LI>framework for the further development of working relationships between pharmacists and physicians.<BR>

<BR>

 	<LI>future joint action between pharmacy and medicine on specific issues in drug therapy<BR>

<BR>

 	<LI>positive response from consumers and the media who view this statement as a collaborative, patient-centered approach to drug therapy, not protecting our "turf".<BR>

<BR>

 	<LI>international recognition.  We have received very positive feedback from several countries and the International Pharmacy Federation (FIP) has indicated that they would be interested in using this "first-ever" document as the basis to develop a FIP statement.<BR>

</UL><BR>



<P><B>DISTRIBUTION</B>:  The joint statement appears in the September issues of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal and the Canadian Medical Association Journal, reaching over 75,000 pharmacists and physicians across Canada.  It is also being sent to provincial, national and international pharmacy and medical organizations, government and consumer groups.<BR>

<BR>

<P>We welcome any comments you might have regarding this statement.  You can contact Jeff Poston or Janet Cooper at the CPhA office or speak directly with your CPhA Board member, President or member of the Executive Committee.<BR>

General Problem-Solving Hints
</title>
<h2>
General Problem-Solving Hints
</h2>
Last Updated: 5th December, 1994
<hr>
Okay, in spite of your careful reading and pre-planning, you discover
that your OS/2 Warp installation is not proceeding as you expected.
What should you do?
<p>
First, step back from the machine and take a deep breath.  Better
yet, go get a cup of coffee, or even take a walk around the block.
If you skipped supper to get an early start, go eat.
<p>
After you finish your break, skim back over the documentation one
more time.  No, it hasn't changed, but &lt;you&gt; have.  You now have more
experience to relate to those dry words on paper; now they make a
little more sense, and sections you skipped before suddenly take on
new relevance.
<p>
Re-read your IRQ & IOA list.  If you didn't already create one, now is
the time; it could save you several hours on the telephone talking to
IBM OS/2 Support and several days' delay before Warp is installed and
ready to run.  If the installation process is mysteriously hanging,
and none of the problem descriptions in this document seem to fit, an
IRQ conflict is always a possibility.
<p>
Re-read Chapter 14 of the "User's Guide to OS/2 Warp".  This was
specifically written to address installation problems and how to
address them.

<a name="tools">
<h3>Tools and Techniques</h3>
</a>
The new boot Alt-F1 (boot to a command line) and Alt-F2 (display
drivers being installed) are not available during the initial phase
of installation.  However, if you boot from the installation floppies
you are given an opportunity to exit to an OS/2 command prompt via
the F3 key.  This will let you run:
<p>
<ul>
<li>RMVIEW (Installation Diskette)
<li>TEDIT (Installation Diskette, Diskette 1)
<li>CHKDSK and FORMAT (Diskette 2, or in \OS2IMAGE\DISK_2 on the CD)
<li>FDISK (Diskette 1, or in \OS2IMAGE\DISK_1 on the CD)
</ul>
<p>

I'll assume that you are already familiar with CHKDSK, FORMAT, and
FDISK. If your experience with these utilities is solely under DOS,
be aware that the OS/2 versions have additional features.

TEDIT is a text-mode line-oriented ASCII file editor.  It is small
(TEDIT.EXE and TEDIT.HLP together weigh in at about 25K), but has all
of the features you need for performing emergency edits to CONFIG.SYS
from an OS/2 Full Screen session. Press F1 to open the Help file.

RMVIEW is new in OS/2 Warp, and its use as a problem determination
tool (together with the RESERVE.SYS pseudodriver) deserves an entire
section to itself, but that will have to wait for version 1.2 at
least.

<a name="diskp">
<h3>Disk Partition Listing</h3>
</a>

If your problem involves disk partitioning, or is related in any way
to hard disk access, having a current and complete description of your
partition layout is esssential.  The simplest way to do this is by
using FDISK to dump a complete report to a file, as in:
<p>
<pre>
  FDISK /QUERY &gt;layout.rpt
</pre>
<p>
You can then print a hard copy of layout.rpt to examine at your
leisure, or include it in in e-mail messages to IBM or others.  Be
sure to add a description of how &lt;you&gt; plan to use the partition as
well.
<p>
For example, here's part of the FDISK /QUERY report from my current
setup, with comments:
<p>
<pre>
Drive Name  Partition Vtype FStype Status   Start     Size

      ** Boot Manager **
    1              :    1    0a      2          0        1

      ** OS/2 2.11 and MS-DOS 5.0 (Dual Boot) **
    1 os2-211     C:    1    06      1          1       80

      ** Warp! (no longer Gamma!) **
    1 os2-warp    D:    2    07      1         81       80

      ** swap partition **
    1             E:    2    06      0        162       50
</pre>
<p>
Translation for undocumented flags:
<p>
<pre>
   Vtype:  1=Primary, 2=Logical Drive
   FSType: 06=FAT, 07=HPFS, 0a=Boot Manager
   Status: 0=Non-bootable, 1=Bootable, 2=Startable
</pre>

<a name="displayp">
<h3>Display Driver Problems</h3>
</a>

This is one of those nasty Catch-22 situations, since it's hard to do
much under OS/2 if your display is not operational.
<p>
With very few exceptions (I'll ignore my experiences with the ISA
Stealth 24 under OS/2 2.1), adapters will run properly in VGA mode.
This isn't the best and most colorful mode, but it will let you get
work done.  Warp has specific boot-time support for switching your
adapter back to VGA mode; all you have to do as you are booting up is
press Alt-F1 when you see the white rectangle (the "boot-blob").
<p>
If, after loading adapter-specific drivers, your display acts oddly,
goes completely black, or suddenly becomes covered with randomly-
colored snow and fails to respond in any recognizable way to Ctl-Esc
or mouse clicks, then shut down and re-boot.  As OS/2 comes up, wait
for the boot-blob, press Alt-F1, and follow the instructions for
switching back to VGA mode.
<p>
Can you do a clean shutdown with a mangled display?  The answer, as
usual, is "it depends".  If the machine is completely locked up, or in
a tight loop in the display driver with interrupts disabled, probably
not.  If OS/2 is still running underneath that odd screen, and it
frequently is, try RMB-clicking on where the Desktop should be to
bring up the System Menu, then pressing the D key to select the
Shut&lt;d&gt;.own entry and pressing the space bar to answer [OK] to the WPS
prompt for confirmation.
<p>
If you have DOS or OS/2 command prompts or DOS or MSWin programs
running, you'll need to press the "Y" key for each to let it complete
the shutdown process.

<a name="driverp">
<h3>Other Driver-related Problems</h3>
</a>

Many of the drivers in CONFIG.SYS were supplied with a /Q ("quiet")
parameter, apparently because IBM prefers a message-less boot. If you
are experiencing problems that may be related to one or more of your
OS/2 drivers, this is not very useful.
<p>
Try adding a /V to any driver that you think might provide additional
information.  If it has a /Q parameter, replace it with a /V.  Details
for many driver parameters are listed in the Warp online Command
Reference in the Information object on the WPS Desktop, but this can
be difficult to reach if you are in the middle of an installation.
<p>

<a name="winos2">
<h3>Problems with WinOS/2</h3>
</a>

If MSWin applications fail to start, and/or the Win-OS/2 Full Screen
object cross-hatches briefly, but nothing further happens, there may
be a simple problem with one or more of the object's drivers or one
of the MSWin DLLs.
<p>
To narrow down your search, you need more information.  The text
messages displayed by a WPS-started Win-OS/2 session are thrown away,
but these may contain information critical to problem determination.
To see the messages, do the following:
<p>
<ul>
   <li>Start a DOS Full Screen session.

   <li>Switch to the MSWin directory (generally \WINDOWS, but mine
     happens to be \MS-WIN31).

   <li>Type:  WINOS2 and watch the messages that appear.

   <li>If you fail to see any usefule messages, but WINOS2 exits without
     giving you a full screen Win-OS/2 session, start it up again,
     adding a /B parameter:
   <p>
   <pre>
      WINOS2 /B
   </pre>
   <p>
   This will create a text file containing the startup messages you
   may have missed.  After WINOS2 exits, examine the contents of this
   file for additional information.
</ul>

One common problem is having critical DLL directories left out of the
active DOS PATH setting.  This can be a user error or the result of an
improperly modified PATH statement in the OS/2 AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
<p>
For example, I re-installed MSWin 3.1 after formatting my Warp Gamma
partition.  I had previously modified the OS/2-created AUTOEXEC.BAT
file by adding several lines, including my own PATH setting.  When I
ran Warp's Selective Install to add WIN-OS/2 suport, it modified the
OS/2 AUTOEXEC.BAT file to add my C:\MS-WIN31 directory to the PATH.
All very reasonable...
<p>
Except that SI modified the &lt;first&gt; PATH statement it saw, which was
the original supplied at Warp installation.  My &lt;customized&gt; PATH
statement, ten lines further down the file, was left untouched.
Result?  I couldn't start any WIN-OS/2 sessions of &lt;any&gt; kind until I
went back and added C:\MS-WIN31 to my own PATH statement.

<a name="adapters">
<h3>Removing Adapters</h3>
</a>

If you experience problems that appear to be hardware related, IBM
OS/2 Support may ask you to remove all non-essential adapters and
devices from your machine.  I have heard remarks from several people
to the effect that doing this was pointless, since without those
adapters or devices (e.g.  a tape backup unit) up and running their
system was useless, and they might as well just throw in the towel...
er, CD.
<p>
The rationale behind pulling all that hardware is not to force you to
work that way forever.  It is intended as a temporary measure to help
get a handle on what is causing your problem.  There are simply too
many things that &lt;could&gt; be causing a given problem to allow each and
every one to be explored.
<p>
A smart problem solver will try to use a divide-and-conquer aproach.
If the problem is still present with all the extra hardware removed,
then it is probably not contributing to the problem.  If it &lt;does&gt; go
away, then the adapters can be replaced, one by one, until the problem
resurfaces.  As a result, less time is spent (by both IBM and you)
chasing down dead-end paths, and in most cases your problem can be
resolved much more quickly.
<p>
It's all a question of getting specific information that is solid
enough for you as a user to make decisions with.  It's the difference
between "Warp won't install" and "Warp won't install on your system as
long as that 8-bit antique 9600-baud modem is installed".  You may not
even care about &lt;why&gt; the two can't co-exist if you were planning to
replace it anyway.  If the adapter &lt;is&gt; critical, you and IBM can
concentrate your efforts on figuring out how to re-jumper it (manual
long since lost) to make it work properly instead of trying to replace
every OS/2 driver in sight.

<h2>
Reporting Problems to IBM
</h2>
Last Updated 5th December, 1994
<hr>
If you are a TalkLink OS2BBS, CompuServe, or Internet user, you don't
have to wait on hold for a "trained technician" - you can report the
problem electronically.  The following is copied from the
IBM-distributed SUPTCTR.INF file, a part of the <a href="ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/pub/os2/info/">800INF.ZIP</a> file sent
out to CompuServe and TalkLink OS2BBS a few weeks back.  I have edited
for reasons of space, so be sure to read the original in full:
<p>
<pre>
  ...

  If ...  you feel that it is the result of a defect with one of the
  IBM OS/2 products listed above, follow this procedure to use
  CompuServe to report the suspected defect:

   o Download <a href="ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/pub/os2/info/">PROBLM.TXT</a> from the IBM Files Library (Library 17) in
     the OS2SUPPORT CompuServe forum.

   o Fill out the PROBLM.TXT as completely as possible using any
     editor.

   o Using CompuServe mail, send the completed PROBLM.TXT form to the
     corresponding IBM OS/2 defect reporting ID.  OS/2 Base Operating
     System defect reports should be mailed to 76711,610.  Extended
     Services or LAN Server defect reports should be mailed to
     76711,611.  (If you are submitting a defect via Internet, the
     problem report should be mailed to 76711.610@compuserve.com for
     the operating system and 76711.611@compuserve.com for Extended
     Services or LAN.)

   IBM will reply as soon as possible, within 48 hours of the time we
   receive your PROBLM.TXT defect report.

   IBM will reply via CompuServe mail to each new PROBLM.TXT defect
   report we receive.  Our reply to you will include a Problem
   Management Record (PMR) number.

   If your problem description matches a previously reported defect
   that has been addressed (closed) by IBM, we will provide the
   explanation, work-around, or directions to obtain a fix.

   If your problem description matches a previously reported defect
   that has not yet been addressed by IBM, we will inform you that you
   have added to the Interested Parties list for the IBM APAR.

   If your problem description does not match a previously reported
   defect, the IBM reply will indicate that your PMR has been
   forwarded to the analysts that specialize in problems of the type
   you reported. ...

   ...
</pre>
<p>
That describes Internet and CompuServe access.  Users with access to
the TalkLink OS2BBS can submit reports directly to IBM from OS2BBS
Main Menu item 2 - IBM Support.
<p>
Please keep in mind that, although your messages may travel at the
speed of light while in transit through the Internet, they can be
delayed by mail servers, and they will be handled by busy human beings
at the far end.  Further, they will probably be handed on to other
busy human beings in the process of resolving your problem. All of
these will add delays to the message loop.
<p>
Try provide as much information as possible on the original message.
Remember that each time IBM Support has to get back to you, it will
take time for them to compose the message, for it to get to you, for
you to compose a reply, and then for it to return to IBM.  The more
complete and specific your information is on the first message the
fewer times OS/2 Support will have to get back in touch with you with
requests for additional information.
<p>
What's that?  Should you add a disk partition layout along with your
adapter, IRQ and IOA information to the report?  Hey, now &lt;there&gt;'s a
thought!  (;-)
<p>
<hr>
<a name="os2info">
<img src="../images/new.gif">
</a>
<p>
IBM has created a PM tool called OS2INFO which makes creating
a problem report to submit to IBM very easy. To get this
package, ftp it from 
<a href="ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/pub/os2/os2fixes/">ftp://software.watson.ibm.com/pub/os2/os2fixes/</a>problm.zip

<H3>Approaches to Enhancing the Quality of Drug Therapy</H3></CENTER><BR>
<HR><BR>
<P>This joint statement was developed by the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association and the
Canadian Medical Association and includes the goal of drug therapy, strategies for collaboration
to optimize drug therapy and physicians' and pharmacists' responsibilities in drug therapy. The
statementrecognizes the importance of patients, pharmacists and physicians working in close
collaborationand partnership to achieve optimal outcomes from drug therapy.<BR>
<BR><BR><HR>
<B>Goal of this Joint Statement</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>The goal of this joint statement is to promote optimal drug therapy by enhancing communication
and working relationships among patients, physicians and pharmacists. It is also meant to serve
as an educational resource for pharmacists and physicians so that they will have a clearer
understanding of each other's responsibilities in drug therapy. In the context of this statement, a
"patient" may include a designated patient representative, such as a parent, spouse, other family
member, patient advocate or health care provider.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Physicians and pharmacists have a responsibility to work with their patients to achieve optimal
outcomes by providing high-quality drug therapy. The important contribution of all members of
the health care team and the need for cooperative working relationships are recognized;
however, this statement focuses on the specific relationships among pharmacists, physicians and
patients with respect to drug therapy. <BR>
<BR>
<P>This statement is a general guide and is not intended to describe all aspects of physicians' or
pharmacists' activities. It is not intended to be restrictive, nor should it inhibit positive
developments in pharmacist-physician relationships or in their respective practices that
contribute to optimal drug therapy. Furthermore, this statement should be used and interpreted in
accordance with applicable legislation and other legal requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<P>This statement will be reviewed and assessed regularly to ensure its continuing applicability to
medical and pharmacy practices.<BR>
<BR>
<BR><HR>
<B>Goal of Drug Therapy</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>The goal of drug therapy is to improve patients' health and quality of life by preventing,
eliminating or controlling diseases or symptoms. Optimal drug therapy is safe, effective,
appropriate, affordable, cost-effective and tailored to meet the needs of patients, who participate,
to the best of their ability, in making informed decisions about their therapy. Patients require
access to necessary drug therapy and specific, unbiased drug information to meet their individual
needs. Providing optimal drug therapy also requires a valid and accessible information base
generated by basic, clinical, pharmaceutical and other scientific research.<BR>
<BR><BR><HR>
<B>Working Together for Optimal Drug Therapy</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Physicians and pharmacists have complementary and supportive responsibilities in providing
optimal drug therapy. To achieve this goal, and to ensure that patients receive consistent
information, patients, pharmacists and physicians must work cooperatively and in partnership.
This requires effective communication, respect, trust, and mutual recognition and understanding
of each other's complementary responsibilities. The role of each profession in drug therapy
depends on numerous factors, including the specific patient and his or her drug therapy, the
prescription status of the drug concerned, the setting and the patient-physician-pharmacist
relationship. However, it is recognized that, in general, each profession may focus on certain
areas more than others. <BR>
<BR>
<P>For example, when counselling patients on their drug therapy, a physician may focus on
disease-specific counselling, goals of therapy, risks and benefits and rare side effects, whereas a
pharmacist may focus on correct usage, treatment adherence, dosage, precautions, dietary
restrictions and storage. Areas of overlap may include purpose, common side effects and their
management and warnings regarding drug interactions and lifestyle concerns. Similarly, when
monitoring drug therapy, a physician would focus on clinical progress toward treatment goals,
whereas a pharmacist may focus on drug effects, interactions and treatment adherence; both
would monitor adverse effects. <BR>
<BR>
<P>Both professions should tailor drug therapy, including education, to meet the needs of individual
patients. To provide continuity of care and to promote consistency in the information being
provided, it is important that both pharmacists and physicians assess the patients' knowledge and
identify and reinforce the educational component provided by the other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR><HR>
<B>Strategies for Collaborating to Optimize Drug Therapy</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Patients, physicians and pharmacists need to work in close collaboration and partnership to
achieve optimal drug therapy. Strategies to facilitate such teamwork include the following.<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI> Respecting and supporting patients' rights to make informed decisions regarding their drug
therapy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Promoting knowledge, understanding and acceptance by physicians and pharmacists of their
responsibilities in drug therapy and fostering widespread communication of these responsibilities
so they are clearly understood by all.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Supporting both professions' relationship with patients, and promoting a collaborative
approach to drug therapy within the health care team. Care must be taken to maintain patients'
trust and their relationship with other caregivers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Sharing relevant patient information for the enhancement of patient care, in accordance and
compliance with all of the following: ethical standards to protect patient privacy, accepted
medical and pharmacy practice, and the law. Patients should inform their physician and
pharmacist of any information that may assist in providing optimal drug therapy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Increasing physicians' and pharmacists' awareness that it is important to make themselves
readily available to each other to communicate about a patient for whom they are both providing
care.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Enhancing documentation (e.g., clearly written prescriptions and communication forms) and
optimizing the use of technology (e.g., e-mail, voice mail and fax) in individual practices to
enhance communication, improve efficiency and support consistency in information provided to
patients.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Developing effective communication and administrative procedures between health care
institutions and community-based pharmacists and physicians to support continuity of care. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Developing local communication channels and encouraging dialogue between the professions
(e.g., through joint continuing education programs and local meetings) to promote a
peer-review-based approach to local prescribing and drug-use issues. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Teaching a collaborative approach to patient care as early as possible in the training of
pharmacists and physicians.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Developing effective communication channels and encouraging dialogue among patients,
physicians and pharmacists at the regional, provincial, territorial and national levels to address
issues such as drug-use policy, prescribing guidelines and continuing professional education.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Collaborating in the development of technology to enhance communication in practices (e.g.,
shared patient databases relevant to drug therapy).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Working jointly on committees and projects concerned with issues in drug therapy such as
patient education, treatment adherence, formularies and practice guidelines, hospital-to-
community care, cost-control strategies, sampling and other relevant policy issues concerning
drug therapy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Fostering the development and utilization of a high-quality clinical and scientific information
base to support evidence-based decision making.<BR></UL>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Physician's Responsibilities in Drug Therapy</B><BR>
<BR>
<P>Physicians and pharmacists recognize the following responsibilities in drug therapy as being
within the scope of physicians' practice, on the basis of such factors as physicians' education and
specialized skills, relationship with patients and practice environment. Some responsibilities may
overlap with those of pharmacists (see The Pharmacist's Responsibilities in Drug Therapy). In
addition, it is recognized that practice environments within medicine may differ and may affect
the physician's role.<BR>

<UL><LI>Assessing health status, diagnosing diseases, assessing the need for drug therapy and
providing curative, preventive, palliative and rehabilitative drug therapy in consultation with
patients and in collaboration with caregivers, pharmacists and other health care professionals,
when appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Working with patients to set therapeutic goals and monitor progress toward such goals in
consultation with caregivers, pharmacists and other health care providers, when appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Monitoring and assessing response to drug therapy, progress toward therapeutic goals and
patient adherence to the therapeutic plan; when necessary, revising the plan on the basis of
outcomes of current therapy and progress toward goals of therapy, in consultation with patients
and in collaboration with caregivers, pharmacists and other health care providers, when
appropriate.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Pharmacists and physicians recognize the following responsibilities in drug therapy as being
within the scope of pharmacists' practice, on the basis of such factors as pharmacists' education
and specialized skills, relationship with patients and practice environment. Some responsibilities
may overlap with those of physicians (see The Physician's Responsibilities in Drug Therapy). In
addition, it is recognized that, in selected practice environments, the pharmacists' role may differ
considerably.<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Evaluating the patients' drug-therapy record ("drug profile") and reviewing prescription orders
to ensure that a prescribed therapy is safe and to identify, solve or prevent actual or potential

     "Following the successful completion of the eSoft/Durand alliance, we are 
aggressively pursuing alliances which will further embed MindWire as the online 
and Internet server of choice. This affiliation with AdeptSoft is an important 
step towards Durand's goal of creating 'Online software with No Limits.' 
Adding an OS/2 and UNIX version of the MindWire server breaks down the 
operating system barrier," says Andre Durand, CEO of Durand.
<p>
     "Durand has done it right with MindWire. Forming an alliance between 
eSoft/Durand and now with AdeptSoft sends a clear signal to online developers 
that Durand is serious in its goal of enabling users to create powerful, 
interactive, multi-media online systems... now developers won't have to 
leave their favorite operating system," says Steven Tower, President of AdeptSoft.
<p>
     "AdeptSoft is a pioneer in 32 bit communications technology. 
Their experience in multi-threading and with the PowerPC will help 
Durand offer faster, stronger cross-platform tools for any size 
developer," says Phil Becker, President of eSoft, Inc. and Director of Durand.
<p>
     The Durand/AdeptSoft alliance calls for AdeptSoft to port Durand's 
MindWire Server and Client technology to run as native OS/2 applications 
running on Intel and PowerPC machines. AdeptSoft also will incorporate 
the MindWire client into its award winning AdeptXBBS product. 
<p>
     "AdeptSoft regards this alliance as a great opportunity to work 
with some of the most experienced and visionary minds in the online 
industry. Combining this alliance with our working relationship with 
IBM will help AdeptSoft in its expansion into remote workgroup software," 
says John Lawlor, CEO of AdeptSoft.
<p>
     MindWire is a powerful online services platform developed for 
the online and Internet community. MindWire allows you to create a 
dynamic multimedia online service offering simultaneous modem, network, 
and Internet connectivity options. Out of the box, MindWire comes 
with E-Mail, Messaging, Chat, Classified Ads and more. MindWire 
provides a robust Database API and Developers Guide for the creation 
of third party client/server applications using any Windows 
programming tool. "MindWire is the next generation World Wide Web--
the applications are entirely interactive and users can access content 
from some of the most powerful databases available," says Andre Durand, 
CEO Durand.
<p>
     AdeptSoft was founded in 1994 in Boca Raton, Florida to develop 
and market innovative communications software technology. AdeptSoft's 
first released product, AdeptXBBS, won "Best OS/2 Product" at 
Cyber.Xpo.95. AdeptXBBS provides clients with a seamless migration 
path for the development of their online service using a standard BBS 
(Bulletin Board System) environment on the OS/2, OS/2 for the PowerPC 
and UNIX platforms. Users of AdeptSofts server software can take full 
advantage of the power and flexibility of today's computers without 
sacrificing compatibility with tomorrow's power computing platforms. 
AdeptSoft is a division of i-way communications, inc.
<p>
     Durand Communications Network, Inc. (Durand), founded in 1991 in 
Santa Barbara, California, provides software products and services for 
the online and Internet community. Durand is a leading provider in 
vertical market applications and has over 1500 clients online and an 
estimated 150,000 online enthusiasts using Durand products. Durand 
has gained an in-depth understanding of the online community as it 
exists today, and possesses the technical capability and vision to 
seize tomorrow's opportunities.

<H1><I>CALLING ALL CANADIANS RESIDENT ABROAD!</I></H1>
<P></CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>
Whether they are based in Bermuda or Bogota, Canadians living overseas have the same questions with
respect to Canadian tax law. If their affairs are properly structured, Canadian expatriates need pay no income tax to Ottawa and enjoy such benefits as no capital gains tax on Canadian investments. The key, however, 
is to "do it right"!
<P>
Learn about establishing non-resident status, the Overseas Employment Tax Credit, tax treaties, non-resident withholding tax and more. Keep abreast of important developments in Canadian tax as it relates to the expatriate 
with a free subscription to UPDATE, the periodic newsletter published by Canadians Resident Abroad Inc. Check out the schedule of upcoming investment seminars hosted by our associate financial planning firm, Canadian
Investment Consultants (888) Inc. in the Middle East, South America and Asia.
<P>

indefinitely, or return to Canada at some time in the future. We recognize that these individuals have tax questions
which require specialized expertise. They expect financial planning advice presented with integrity and concern for
their financial well-being. We understand the importance of adapting to changing personal and financial needs.

<CENTER><IMG SRC=http://www.cdc.net/~drjekyll/negscooby/images/evlgang2.gif WIDTH=530 HEIGHT=354></CENTER>
<STRONG><P>The Nega- Scooby Doo Gang is a group of misfits that find great pleasure in trying to do others harm. It is built of a kind of a mix between evil twins and the dark side of the do-good mystery solving team known as the Scooby Doo Gang. In an effort to make their counterparts' lives miserable the Nega- Scooby Doo Gang has continually tried to wreak much (but this unwittingly gives their counterparts more business). In this effort, they have recruited many people to help them in their escapades. These recruites are the ones that always appear being caught by the real Scooby Doo Gang on the shows, while the core members of the Nega- Scooby Doo Gang work behind the scenes. The key members' aliases are Evil-minded Thelma, Hot stuff Freddy, Dark Daphne, Devil Doo, and Disgruntled Shaggy. Also, there is another character that has recently been found to be connected to the twisted gang. It's name, Scrappy Doo. This character was recruited by the evil gang in order to infiltrate the ranks of the real Scooby Doo Gang pretending to act in awe of his "Uncle Scooby". His mission while there was to shorten the length of mysteries to 15 minutes and without Fred, Thelma, or Daphne. Although Scrappy was persistent he was not able to sneak into the Pup Named Scooby Doo mysteries. One other thing that can be tied to the Nega- Scooby Doo Gang are the errors that pop up in episodes  from time to time. These are pranks pulled off by the gang in order to make their counterparts look bad. Remember, when reading the key characters' profiles that they are sometimes evil because the characters are EVIL!</P>
<P>Thanx go out to <A HREF="mailto:ztml3@access.east-tenn-st.edu">Tonya Luster</A> for helping me expand the info on Scrappy!

In Ottawa, they met with Michael Quebec, Director of Revenue Canada's International Tax Services Office, assistant directors Peter Schryburt and Natalie Stibernik, and members of their staff. As always, the discussion was wide-ranging, cordial and informative. Read on!<A NAME="B"></A><H3>Children Boarding With Relatives</H3><P>Longtime UPDATE readers will recall our protracted correspondence with Revenue Canada concerning the residency status of expatriate Canadian parents who leave a child in a Canadian boarding school. At that time (August, 1993), Revenue Canada personnel wrote to us stating that if the parents had severed all ties but one - a dependent child enrolled in a Canadian boarding school - they would be considered non-residents for tax purposes. That response was quite specific to the boarding school situation, stating, "The economic dependency is there but the day-to-daycare and nurturing of that child has been taken over professionally by a non-relative."<P>We were left wondering whether Revenue Canada's position would differ if the same expatriate parents left their under age children in the care of relatives in Canada rather than at boarding school. So, we asked the question!<P>In a letter confirming items discussed at our most recent meeting, International Tax Services Office Director, Michael Quebec, replied, "Whether the child stays in a boarding school or with a relative such as an aunt or a grandparent generally would make no difference to the residency status of the parent. As we discussed, residency is a question of fact. All the facts must be looked at for each individual case. The fact that a child is at boarding school or with a relative is not usually the only fact that will make a parent considered to be aresident of Canada for tax purposes. The residency status would be dependent on the other ties to Canada such as health coverage, bank accounts, etc."<P>So, it seems from this response that expatriate parents who are very careful to sever all other ties to Canada may be able to leave a child in the care of relatives without jeopardizing their non-resident status. Nonetheless, we have to warn you, as we have in the past, that a letter such as this from Revenue Canada merely expresses an opinion and is in no way binding. As always, the tax department reserves the right to examine the facts of every individual case.<A NAME="C"></A><H3>Canadian Credit Card</H3><P> We asked for confirmation of Revenue Canada's position onthe impact which the retention and use of a Canadian credit card would have on an individual's non-resident status. Mr. Quebec wrote to us, "The use of a Canadian credit card is considered a minor tie with Canada. We indicated to you that aslong as an individual has severed all their primary ties, had very few secondary ties but retained and used a Canadian credit card, that it would not cause them to be considered resident of Canada."<P>Our tax advisor, Garry Duncan, C.A., Tax Partner, BDO Dunwoody, would append some additional advice. If you wish to be considered non-resident and plan to retain a Canadian credit card, be sure to change the address of record to your foreign address and confine its use to offshore spending!<A NAME="D"></A><H3> Non-Resident Landlords</H3><P> We also discussed the situation of non-residents who have rental property in Canada and have failed to properly report rental income to Revenue Canada.  In order to paytax on a net basis, a non-resident landlord must either first pay tax on the gross rent (technically to be withheld and submitted by the tenant), then file a tax return claiming a refund, or arrange in advance to pay on the net rent only by appointing a Canadian agent and filing both Form NR6 and a tax return withinthe applicable time limits. <B>These procedures must be followed even if the property is operating at a net loss.</B><P>Unfortunately, some non-residents are not aware of these requirements. When such individuals come forward voluntarily to pay tax owing after the time limits have expired, they may be faced with tax on gross rent plus applicable interest. In his own tax practice,  BDO Dunwoody's Garry Duncan felt that he had recently encountered a decreased willingness on the part of Revenue Canada to extend the relevant time limits in such cases. When we broached this subject in ourmeeting, Revenue Canada officials acknowledged that extensions of time were in their authority to grant but stressed that each case would be considered on its own merits.<P>The obvious solution to the problems outlined above is to handle non-residentrental income correctly from the outset.  If you would like us to send you some further information on declaring rental income on a net basis and a copy of FormNR6, please tick the appropriate box on the final page of this UPDATE.<P>For any readers who have not been properly declaring rental income, Garry Duncan recommends disclosing this situation to Revenue Canada and requesting an extension of the filing deadline. While the consequences may be costly if the extension is denied, the situation will inevitably come to light at some point in the future, when the property is sold.<A NAME="E"></A><H3>WHERE SHOULD THE CANADIAN EXPATRIATE INVEST NOW?</H3><P> Six months ago, Canadian Investment Consultants (888) Inc., the associate overseas financial planning firm and sponsor of Canadians Resident Abroad Inc., made portfolio recommendations to our non-resident clients which were also published in Issue 11(Fall 1995) of UPDATE. A registered Canadian mutual fund dealer, CIC bases its asset allocation recommendations on a thorough knowledge of the needs of the Canadian expatriate (including tax considerations), solid past performance among fund managers and current analysis of conditions in various world markets.<P>The chart below sets out the results you would have achieved if you had invested $100,000 on October 1, 1995 in accordance with our suggestions and held your investment to March 31, 1996. All the recommended funds moved upward substantially over the six-month period, resulting in an overall gain of 9.14%. Over the past year, in fact, from March 31, 1995, this same portfolio has shown again of 18.40%. See the chart for details.<P>Where, then, should the Canadian expatriate invest now? Clients of Canadian Investment Consultants (888) Inc. have access to our most up-to-date investment analysis through ongoing contact with a CIC representative. If you would like to review our current asset allocation advice, simply tick the appropriate box on the back page of this UPDATE and we will be pleased to send you a summary. Better yet, ask for a copy of our Financial Health Profile form to fill out and return and we will prepare a comprehensive, customized report as to your probable financial future and options as to how to improve same.<P>Canadian Investment Consultants seminars have been held recently in such places as Malaysia, the U.A.E., Saudi Arabia, Colombia and Chile. However, there is no need to wait either for a seminar in your area of the world or for a visit home to Canada to get in touch with us. Just indicate that you would like to hear from us, give us your telephone number and we will undertake to call you anywhere in the world at no cost or obligation to you.<P><TABLE BORDER=2><TR><TD><CENTER><H3>Six Month and One Year Performance of $100,000 (Canadian) Invested</H3><H4>Proportionately divided among five Canadian based mutual funds inaccordance with recommendations set out in UPDATE, Issue 11 (Fall 1995)</H4></CENTER>

Unit values, yields and investment returns will fluctuate.</TD></TR></TABLE><A NAME="G"></A><H3>FOREIGN REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CANADIAN RESIDENTS</H3><P> The Canadian government has finally released the draft legislation and forms needed to implement new foreign reporting requirements announced over a year ago. Starting for the 1996 taxation year, Canadian residents with interests in foreign property (shares, bank accounts,real property, etc.) costing in excess of $100,000 must report and provide details on such holdings. Canadian residents with foreign affiliates will have to provide additional financial and tax information with respect to each affiliate. Canadian beneficiaries of certain non-resident trusts will also be required to file an information return for the year in which they receive a distribution from the trust. In addition, Canadian residents who have transferred or loaned property to a non-resident trust will generally be required to file an annual information return in respect of the trust.<P>Certain types of property will be excluded. For example, a home in another country would likely be considered "personal use property" and be exempt from the reporting requirements.<P>Residents of Canada are, of course, already obliged to disclose their worldwide income in their tax returns. However, according to the Minister of Finance, the new reporting requirements "will give Revenue Canada more ability to scrutinize offshore investments by Canadians and to ensure the complete reporting of income."<P>Where taxpayers fail to comply, the legislation contains a number of severe penalties. These include penalties for failure to file the return and/or for providing incorrect information. For example, failure to submit certain of the returns could result in a monthly penalty of $500, up to $12,000. Failing to file for 24 months could result in an additional penalty of 10% of the value of the holdings in question - possibly a very substantial sum depending on the value ofthe investment!<P>If you would like a copy of the Finance Minister's Press Release, the draft information returns and BDO Dunwoody's summary report on the new reporting requirements, please tick the appropriate box on the final page of this UPDATE.<P><A NAME="H"></A><H3> Global Medical Insurance</H3><P>Global Medical Insurance That Meets The Needs Of Canadian Expatriates! As most readers of UPDATE are aware, we have hunted and hunted for a medical plan that would yield reasonable-cost global medical insurance coverage for Canadian expatriates.<P>Once you have scanned the enclosed brochure from the Indianapolis-based International Medical Group we believe that you will agree that we have found what we have been looking for.<P>Actually, we ourselves did not find IMG. They found us! During a recent visit to Moscow, the head of IMG came upon UPDATE's "CALLING ALL CANADIANS RESIDENT ABROAD" advertisement in the Moscow Times.<P>In consequence, IMG contacted UPDATE here in Oakville. R.W. McRae of Canadian Investment Consultants (888) Inc. promptly paid them a visit in Indianapolis. The enclosed global medical insurance offering is the result.<A NAME="J"></A><H3>CPP/OAS TAX CHANGES PROMPT 40,000 PHONE CALLS TO REVENUE CANADA</H3><P> About a year ago we told you that, effective January 1996, the Canadian government planned to tax Canada Pension Plan/Quebec Pension Plan and Old Age Security payments received by non-residents of Canada, and to reduce or eliminate OAS payments to higher income non-resident pensioners, based on a reporting of their world income.<P>In a joint project aimed at notifying all current non-resident pensioners of the changes, Human Resources Development Canada (the department which administers the benefits) and the International Tax Services Office of Revenue Canada have sent two explanatory packages to over 100,000 pensioners who normally receive their cheques at addresses outside of Canada. International Tax Services installed extra telephone lines to field the more than 40,000 calls which had resulted by mid-February. According to the Revenue Canada representatives we met with,if any of those who received the packages are actually resident of Canada for tax purposes despite their out-of-country addresses, it will be the pensioner's responsibility to notify Revenue Canada not to withhold non-resident tax.<A NAME="K"></A><H3>Non-Resident Tax</H3><P> Non-residents who receive CPP/QPP will now have non-resident withholding tax deducted from their monthly cheques.  The rate of tax will be 25% unless this is reduced by the terms of a tax treaty between Canada and the pensioner's country of residence. Some non-residents, who derive substantially all of their world income from Canadian sources, may benefit from electing tofile a tax return. Those who qualify will be taxed at the same rate as residents of Canada and will be permitted to use certain non-refundable tax credits. <A NAME="L"></A><H3>OAS Recovery Tax</H3><P> OAS received by a non-resident, on the other hand, is now subject to both non-resident tax and a "recovery tax" or clawback. Recovery tax will be applied at a rate of 11.25% of the amount by which the individual's net world income exceeds $53,215 (as reported on the new OAS Return of Income). In practice, this means that an individual whose net world income exceeds $84,000 per year will have his or her entire OAS payment taxed away.<P>In order to ensure that July 1996 cheques are not delayed, non-resident recipients are obliged to submit the OAS Return of Income by April 30,1996. Only those who reside in countries which are "recovery tax exempt" due to treaty provisions (see below) are not required to report. If a report is not filed, the full amount of OAS payments will be withheld. <A NAME="M"></A><H3>Tax Treaties</H3><P> If you live in a tax treaty country, your Canadian tax burdenmay be considerably reduced. Residence in one of about 25 countries (slightly less than half the total number of countries which have tax treaties with Canada) will exempt the OAS recipient entirely from the recovery tax and reduce the rate of withholding tax on both OAS and CPP/QPP. The actual rate of withholding tax varies.  Recipients living in the U.K., Denmark and Trinidad and Tobago pay no tax at all, while those in most other countries in the group pay 15%. Of course,these benefits may well be taxable in the recipient's country of residence. By the same token, tax paid to Canada may qualify for a foreign tax credit in the country of residence. <A NAME="N"></A><H3>March 1996 Federal Budget</H3><P> Ironically, the March 1996 Federal Budget announced planned changes to the benefits system which will, by the year 2001, replace the OAS, Guaranteed Income Supplement, age credit and pension income credit with a single Seniors Benefit, designed to assist lower income individuals. We will keep you posted on the implications for non-residents.<P>If you would like to receive a copy of the material sent out by Revenue Canada regarding taxation of CPP/QPP and OAS, please tick the appropriate box on the <A HREF="subscribe.html">subscription page of this UPDATE</A>. Those of you who requested this information in the past will find it enclosed with this issue.<P><BR><BR><CENTER><A HREF="/cgi-bin/htimage/menu.map"><IMG ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=0 SRC="menu.gif" ISMAP></A></CENTER><BR><BR><BR></BODY></HTML>

Hey there!!!   If you know me, then there really isn't any reason to be
here because i havent said anything.   If you dont know me....then why are
you even here???   j/k    
<p>
Yes that is a picture of me.  What am i doing you ask?  I am spending a
weekend with friends at a Crown Tournament event for the
 <a href="http://www.sca.org/">Society for Creative Anachronism</a> in the
 Kingdom of Meridies.
<p>
When i am not playing during the week, i work at 
<a href="http://www.utc.edu/commdept/WUTC.html">WUTC</a>
 as the weekend manager, producer, and friendly neighborhood dj.  You can
catch my shows on Saturdays and Sundays in the Chattanooga vicinity by
tuneing in to 88.1fm.  Or not...suit yourself.
<p>
OK...now to personal matters....my fiance
 (tenative wedding set for July at legba's)!  His name is Steven (irc 
nick Syrass) and i met him on irc more than a year ago. Right now he
lives in Australia and i have learned the true meaning of a long distance
relationship.  Even the planet that separates us has not been able to stop
our love though.  Wanna see a pic of him??
<p>
<img height=369 width=208 src="http://www.cdc.net/~rabbit/syrass2.jpg"
alt="pic 'o Syrass"
align="left">
Isn't he just the cuteist thing!!! (He's gonna kill me for that remark!) 
Oh, btw, the baby is NOT his...but is a real sweetie and the child of a
dear friend.  Syrass has been the keeper of my heart and the love of my
life since August 1995.  He is also the reason no one can get through on
my phone, cuz i spend all my free time on the computer chatting with
Syrass and our irc friends, or talking on the phone to him.  (please dont
even mention long distance phone bills...but i would suggest buying stock
in AT&T).
<p>
I have many more pictures of him which i would love to share with you...as
soon as i scan them in.  Look for a photo albumn link here one of these
days....trust me..it'll happen.

is a good friend that is teaching me how to do this.  Be sure you say hi
to him.)

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
That some provinces now require returning expats to wait up to three months before they can rejoin the provincial health insurance scheme? 
<P>
Until recently, a Canadian who fell ill while living overseas could return to Canada and count
on virtually immediate acceptance into a provincial/territorial health insurance plan. However, in an effort to ensure that only those individuals genuinely resident
in their jurisdiction receive coverage, certain provinces (British Columbia, Ontario and New Brunswick at time of writing) have instituted waiting periods of up to three months for returning Canadians.
Ontario and B.C. will require that returning expats further demonstrate their intent to take up permanent residence by spending no more than 30 days outside of the province in the first six months after their arrival.
<P>
Returning residents should investigate whether any waiting period will be covered by the provisions of the health insurance policy which insured them and their family overseas. Three-month extensions are becoming routine 
for Canadian companies with expatriate clients but will be less familiar to insurers based outside Canada. Never assume you will be covered without checking with your insurance provider. If continuation of an overseas policy 
cannot be arrnaged some assistance is available from insurance companies who offer insurance for travellers. These companies will provide that same type of "emergency" coverage for visitors to 
Canada. Policies are likely to cover emergency care but not treatment for pre-existing conditions, checkups and the like.
<P>
<Most of these insurers require that coverage begin within a few days of entry into the country. Delay in applying may make an applicant ineligible. Depending on the company, it may be possible to arrange in advance for coverage, to commence on your date of arrival. Payment 
can generally be made by credit card.
<P>

<HEAD><TITLE>About this year's theme </TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BACKGROUND = "http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>About this Year's Theme</H2>
<BR>
<P>Pharmacists in Canada from all areas of practice will soon be celebrating another Pharmacy
Awareness Week  (November 4-10, 1996) in cities, towns and rural areas across the country.  
Pharmacy Awareness Week is the profession's annual public awareness and education campaign
and is a joint initiative of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association (CPhA), the Canadian Society
of Hospital Pharmacists (CSHP) and the Canadian Association of Pharmacy Students and Interns
(CAPSI).  <BR>
<BR>
<P>Each year, a theme relevant to the health of all Canadians is chosen. Pharmacists then organize
and participate in activities to promote and celebrate their profession at the grassroots level.
Events vary from pharmacy to pharmacy and community to community, but the purpose is shared:
to highlight the vital role pharmacists play every time they provide patients with hands-on
solutions to health care problems. Solutions include identifying, preventing and resolving
drug-related problems and counselling to help patients receive the most benefit from their drug
therapy.  <BR>
<BR>
<P>In 1996, the theme for Pharmacy Awareness Week is: Shared Care: You and Your Pharmacist. 
This year's theme reinforces the fact that better health is a shared responsibility, one that patients
can share with their pharmacist, the most accessible health care provider. We want to remind
Canadians that pharmacists, in addition to being the experts on medication and its proper use, can
answer many health questions. We need to inform the public about the valuable information
services and advice they can, and should, be seeking from their pharmacist. We want to increase
efforts to inform the public about pharmacists' roles and responsibilities to them as providers of
pharmaceutical care.<BR><BR>
<P>In a rapidly changing national health environment, we also have to inform people about the
"bigger picture" and the millions of dollars pharmacists save Canada's health care system every
year.  In 1993 alone, interventions by pharmacists saved an estimated   $388.5 million, or $64,000
per pharmacy, according to the national Community Pharmacist Intervention Study (CPhIS)
conducted by CPhA, which sampled over 500 pharmacies. The study estimates that, on a national
level, Canadian pharmacists make over 6.16 million prescription and 15.28 million nonprescription
interventions per year.<FONT size=1>1, 2</FONT> <BR><BR>
<P>Another study, the Clinical Pharmacy Services Study (CPSS), which looked at benefits of applied
clinical pharmacy to hospitalized patients, showed savings to the system of $4.75 per day in
decreased drug costs for each patient intervention. The impact of these interventions were judged
by both physicians and pharmacists to improve patient care and reduce the risks associated with
drug therapy.<FONT size=1>3</FONT><BR><BR>
<P>Other studies demonstrate the impact of our profession on both individual patients' health and the
health care system at large. If we are to grow stronger as a profession, we have to take bold steps
to stake our ground in the new Canadian health care reality.
Finally,  remember that Pharmacy Awareness Week is a week of opportunity. Not only can we
use this week to inform our patients of what we can do for them, but also we can use it to remind
ourselves of the good things we do for others.
If everyone does a little, we can achieve a lot. Whether you set up a small display or organize a
large event, read on for more information about how to get the most out of your campaign!

<H3>IDEAS FOR PROMOTING PAW '96</H3>
<BR>
<P>Whether you work in a community or hospital pharmacy, industry or health administration or are
studying to become a pharmacist, Pharmacy Awareness Week is for you! The activities you
organize put you and your profession front and centre. <BR>
<BR>
<P>You are the key spokesperson for this campaign. The media and public do not want to speak with
someone who is "light years away" in a "national office."  They want to speak with you - one of
the most accessible health professionals in their community. Do not underestimate the importance
of the advocacy opportunities PAW provides. Remember to enjoy yourself and be creative, too.<BR>
<BR>
<H4>"How" to Plan for PAW</H4>
<BR>
<UL><LI>  Identify the people who want to be involved in organizing for PAW, including pharmacy
technicians and other staff members. Call them together. The earlier the better!<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Share this Resource Manual with them and discuss the ideas.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Establish your goals and objectives and assess your resources for PAW.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> If you are planning events outside your pharmacy setting, contact the people with whom you
will have to make arrangements. Start thinking about invitations. They should be sent three to
four weeks before the event.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Order the education and promotional materials you will need early. See the catalogue and order
form on page 12 and inside back cover. Notice the price breaks for members of the PAW partner
organizations - CPhA, CSHP and CAPSI. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> If you need a speech, start working on it now.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> It's never too soon to start making contacts with the media. See the <A HREF="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/paw/paw12.htm">media tips section</A> for more information.</UL><BR>
<BR><BR>
<H4>"What" to Plan for PAW</H4>
<BR>
<P>The following is a list of ways to inform your patients and the public at large that pharmacists are
medication experts and much, much  more. <BR>
<BR>
<P>During PAW, any of the following activities will go a long way to remind your patients that   you
offer a wealth of knowledge, skill and experience when they share their care with you.<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI> Order the promotional items offered in the catalogue (see the inside back cover). They reinforce
the theme and messages we are trying to convey through PAW.  This year, we have paid special
attention to creating a product line that emphasizes patient education.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Order the patient brochure and temporary tattoos as bag stuffers or handouts at information
sessions. We've even printed special prescription bags that help you educate your patients about
the things you do for them every day!<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Order t-shirts and buttons for you, your colleagues and staff to wear during PAW. Purchase
mugs to give to your staff as thank you gifts for going above and beyond the call  of duty during
PAW.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Brighten up the pharmacy with our colourful balloons, complete with the PAW logo.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Hang this year's poster in a highly visible spot. You will receive a copy of the poster, free of
charge, with the September issue of the Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal (CPJ) or through a
mailing in September to the CSHP membership. Order additional copies!  <BR>
<BR>
<LI> Be sure to have lots of information on hand to distribute to patients.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Mention PAW in any and all available publications, depending on your practice setting (e.g., a
community pharmacist may have a practice newsletter;  a hospital pharmacist may have access to
the hospital newsletter; pharmacy students may be able to access the university newspaper). And
do not forget the Internet!  If you have a homepage, set up some information. For valuable
Internet sources, refer to page 7.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Personally mention PAW to your patients during and around the time of the campaign.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Make a commitment to follow up by telephone with at least five of your patients during PAW. 
Ask them how they are feeling. Find out how their drug therapy is working. Imagine the impact if
every pharmacist in Canada did this. Five phone calls each would add up to a wave across the
nation, where more than 22,000 pharmacists would have spoken with more than 110,000 
patients! <BR>
<BR>
<LI> Remind patients of why PAW is so important - that you want them to understand the important
role you can play in their health.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Contact the local schools and offer to speak on the proper use of medications and other health
issues. You might also want to speak about careers in pharmacy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Offer to visit a seniors' residence for an information session.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Consider hosting a special event, such as an open house or a PAW kick-off, at your practice
setting.  Invite patients and their families, community leaders and other health professionals from your
community. Use the opportunity to show them exactly what you do. Demonstrate how
pharmaceutical care works by showing how you act as an essential patient care provider and drug
therapy expert. Show them the tools you can make available to them every day of the year. Invite
the mayor or other local politician to be present to cut a ribbon or a cake.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Organize a special health day or clinic on the management of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, 
asthma, high blood pressure or arthritis. You might consider conducting sessions on preventive
health matters, such as smoking cessation;  pregnancy, breastfeeding and infant care;  sexually
transmitted diseases; medicine cabinet clean-up;  first aid supplies;  home care equipment.
Determine what kind of program you will have based on your practice setting and the kinds of
patients you serve. Team up with other health associations and providers to show how you
interact with other health professionals to provide quality care for your patients. Contact your
local public health department, which can often provide additional information as hand-outs for
your patients. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>  With pharmacists from other practice areas and students, set up and staff a display at a local
shopping mall. Be sure to have lots of information to hand out on a variety of topics. Try inviting  
a local celebrity, such as the TV news weatherperson, to be present when your display is likely to
be busy. Often, public affairs divisions of local radio and television stations will make such arrangements
for their on-air personalities. You might even be featured during the local suppertime news hour!<BR>
<BR>
<LI>  Volunteer to speak to local Chambers of Commerce or other community groups about
increases in drug plan costs and rising costs associated with noncompliance and inappropriate
drug use. Demonstrate how those costs can be reduced when you become an integral part of the
solution. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>  PAW is a great opportunity to demonstrate to employers that pharmacists are uniquely
positioned as drug experts to ensure that drug therapies work and that patients receive optimal
benefits from their medication. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Set up meetings with group benefits plan managers. Explain how pharmaceutical care leads to
lower costs and healthier employees. The National Pharmacy Coalition on Managed Care can
provide you with support materials for a presentation on this topic. For information, contact Jean
Hunter, CPhA, at 1-800-917-9489 or your provincial association.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Organize a forum that brings together various health professionals in the community. Build it
around a specific disease, condition or issue, such as child immunization,  AIDS or even health
care reform. Whatever the issue, be sure it focuses on encouraging more cooperation and
information sharing among health professionals and the public.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Do you have a special area of interest or professional specialty? Build your awareness campaign
around this. Use PAW as an opportunity to inform or remind your patients that you can provide
even more in-depth services in your area of expertise.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>  Volunteer your services to organize a local town hall meeting to discuss changes to Canada's
health care system. Contact other health professionals in your community. Then ask your Member
of Parliament or member of your provincial legislature for support.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>  Make sure that politicians at all levels of government, whether you know them personally or
not, know about PAW!  Ask them to publish one of the media releases contained in the media tips
section (pages 8-10) in their next mailing to constituents.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>  Have the Mayor of your city or town proclaim PAW. Use the sample proclamation available
through CPhA's Fax-Info line service, document #1212. For more information on how to use Fax-Info
 line, refer to the additional resource section at the bottom of this page. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> Ensure that every receipt that leaves your pharmacy includes information about PAW.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Ask the local newspaper to run a copy of the pictures, maze game and information from the
tear-off pads in its Saturday morning children's section (see catalogue, inside back cover). Suggest
that the newspaper run a colouring contest using your material. Award a small prize to children
who complete and deliver the picture to your pharmacy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Using the tear-off pads, run a colouring contest from your pharmacy. You might consider
making it an essay-writing contest for children. Ask them to write a short note about what a
pharmacist is and does and why you are their friend. Encourage them to draw pictures. Remember
to give lots of information to help them write it. Offer prizes, such as temporary tattoos or
colouring books. Use the entries to make a display in your pharmacy. <BR>
<BR>
<LI> Be sure to use the media tips and camera-ready materials included in this manual. Community
newspapers are often gold mines for providing editorial space to cover local awareness
campaigns; likewise for community television, radio stations and community cable TV. Their
larger counterparts tend to be more interested in "hard news"  stories, which makes it more
difficult to secure editorial space for "good news" stories such as PAW. Look to the media
section of this manual (pages 8-10) for more information and ready-made releases to support your
media efforts. <BR></UL>
<BR>
<P>Any of the above ideas, and countless others, will work or can be adapted to suit your  practice
setting. Whatever you do and whatever your setting, start planning now. And remember to thank
everyone once your successful event has passed!

<HEAD><TITLE>MAKING THE MOST OF THE MEDIA</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<BODY BACKGROUND="http://www.cdnpharm.ca/greybck.gif">
<H2>MAKING THE MOST OF THE MEDIA</H2>
<BR>
<P>After all your efforts to organize your PAW event, you will want to ensure maximum publicity to
bring your message to the widest audience. It helps to understand what gets noticed and why.<BR>
<BR>
<P>Reporters and editors are interested in relating news stories to the community in which they
happen. For something to have news value, it must have an impact on the general community. In
other words, if you can convince reporters or editors that a story is important to the public, they
will write about it or broadcast it.<BR>
<BR>
<P>The essential elements to keep in mind when preparing a news release is that it must tell a story
about real people, it must be timely, and it must have local appeal and interesting subject matter. <BR>
<BR>
<P>The work you do every day, including the activities you will organize during PAW, meets these
criteria, so it becomes a matter of how to "package" your activity to sell it to the media. Keep in
mind that there are several kinds of media coverage: <BR>
<UL><LI>  news (which usually involves conflict, controversy or change)<BR>
<BR>   features (usually stories of human interest that are not always specifically tied to a time or         
    event)<BR>
<LI>   editorials (usually coverage by the media that takes a stand on an issue of relevance to the         
    general public)<BR>
<BR>   op-eds (also opinion-oriented but usually contributed by someone outside the news                    
     organization).</UL><BR>
<BR>
<P>For events such as Pharmacy Awareness Week, coverage tends to fall in all but the first category.
<BR>
<P>You can maximize the impact of your media campaign by making contact with the media in
advance and providing them with ideas and editorial copy (see a sample news release, radio
PSAs [public service announcements], a community column and a newspaper ad in the pages to
follow).<BR>
<BR>
<P>When you send your news release, call the local reporter or prepare for an interview, follow these
general tips:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>   Try to anticipate the reporter's needs.<BR>
<LI>   Know what you are going to say, and say it with clarity and confidence.<BR>
<LI>  Learn and respect reporters' deadlines.<BR>
<LI>   Be available to reporters if they have to call you back.<BR>
<LI>   Be prompt in returning reporters' calls.<BR>
<LI>   Be honest.  Always tell the truth. If you do not know the answer, say so and tell them you will  
    get back to them with the correct response.<BR>
<LI>   If you are to be photographed or filmed for a pharmacy story, ask to be seen counselling a       
    patient rather than  in the dispensary pouring and counting tablets. Remember to promote       
    yourself as a pharmacist in the 1990s!<BR></UL>

Would leaving a child in school in Canada constitute a residential tie?</H3>
</CENTER>
<P><IMG SRC="dyk.gif">
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
That leaving a child borading in a Canadian private school does not automatically make the expat parents resident in Canada for tax purposes?
<P>
Canadians Resident Abroad investigated the question of whether Canadian expatriate parents who
have severed all other ties with Canada risk losing their non-resident status by enrolling their child in a Canadian boarding school.
<P>
We started with a documented case - Canadian parents forced to move their child from his B.C. boarding school to a school in Switzerland
because Revenue Canada had informed them they would be unable to establish non-resident status as long as their child remained in a Canadian boarding school.
<P>
We engaged the Toronto law firm of Borden and Elliot to Revenue Canada on our behalf asking whether having a child in a Canadian boarding 
school would be sufficient to make parents without other ties resident in Canada. This time, Revenue Canada replied that in the case of "an individual/parent 
who severs all Canadian ties but one - a dependent child enrolled in a Canadian boarding school... the residency status of this individual/parent would be ruled
<B>non-resident</B>"(our emphasis)
<P>
Ottawa's support for this conclusion was two-fold: "Foreign students pay higher fees and the school assumes responsibility for this child... The economic
dependency is there but the day-to-day care and nurturing of that child has been taken over professionally by a non-relative."
<P>
Revenue Canada further stated that "the department would require proof that the individual/parent was paying foreign student fees." 
In fact, of 16 Canadian boarding schools which replied to a Canadians Resident Abroad survey, 8 indicated that they charge identical fees to all students regardless of where their parents reside.
<P>
So Borden and Elliot went back into the fray, writing to Revenue Canada that in their opinion "the relevant factor is whether the day-to-day care and nurturing of the child has been taken over by a non-relative"
and not whether "the individual/parent was paying foreign student fees."
<P>
Borden and Elliot asked for confirmation that "Revenue Canada will not determine a parent's residency status based on the fact that the parent
is paying higher tuition fees than parents who are Canadian residents."
<P>
In their reply at this time around Revenue Caanda (happily for us) stated, "we can confirm that the amount of the fee paid is not a 
consideration in determining the residential status of the parents of a child attending a boarding school in Canada."
<P>
While we felt we had accomplished something through all this voluminous ( and expensive) correspndence, the progress was so fragmentary
that we didn't feel comfortable unless we had an expert summarize the outcome for us.
<P>
In consequence we obtained a letter, available from <A HREF="mailto:cra-hq@cdnsresabroad.com">CRA</A> from Borden and Elliot. We draw particular attention to the cautionary concluding paragraph. Apparently even written technical interpretations merely provide us with "comfort". An actual
court case would be the only way to establish a legal precedent.

<H2>Sample News Release</H2>

<P>For Immediate Release - November 4, 1996

<B><P>Pharmacists Highlight "Full Scope" Services 
during Annual Awareness Week</B>
<BR><BR>
<P>(Your City/Province)  Pharmacists are working to ensure that Canadians take notice of their
profession during Pharmacy Awareness Week, November 4-10, 1996. The theme of this year's
campaign is Shared Care:  You and Your Pharmacist.  Pharmacists are organizing and
participating in activities that demonstrate the scope of services they can provide to help patients
achieve optimal outcomes from their drug therapy and improve their health.<BR>
<BR>
<P>"Everyone uses the services of pharmacists, but many people do not know how to receive the
maximum value and benefit from these services,"  says  your name, pharmacist at  your
workplace. "Individuals take unnecessary risks with their health if they do not have all the
information they need to take their medicine properly,  be it prescription or nonprescription. 
We're here to help, but it's important for patients to know that good health is a shared
responsibility."<BR>
<BR>
<P>Each year an estimated 12,500 lives and 2 million work days are lost in Canada because people
do not take their medications properly. A recent review estimated that approximately 50% of
people do not take their prescription medications exactly as prescribed,  at a cost to Canada's
health care system of $7 to $9 billion per year in direct and indirect costs. It has also been
estimated that each year drug noncompliance is the cause of 10% of all hospital admissions, up to
25% of hospital admissions for the elderly and 23% of all nursing home admissions. <BR>
<BR>
<P>Recent research has estimated that interventions by Canadian pharmacists actually save the
health care system close to $400 million, or $66,000 per pharmacy. <BR>
<BR>
<P>"We are advocating prevention during Pharmacy Awareness Week," says your name.  "Our
patients should know that they can and should talk to us about their medications and health
concerns. We are here to `share their care'."<BR>
<BR>
<P>Pharmacy Awareness Week is sponsored by the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, the
Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists, the Canadian Association of Pharmacy Students and
Interns, and your local pharmacy.<BR>

My fingers wrap gently around the inside of his waist,
my love's flesh warm and rough against my fingertips.

My hands slide along the front of his body,
my fingers stretching upward toward his chest,
and I feel his stomach suck in.
My love, trying to hide his extra 10 pounds. My sweet.

My legs press against his,
his body pushes hard against me.
He says,
"I love you, Michael,"
and our lips touch.

But then I see myself standing,
facing myself in a full-length cedar-lined mirror.
Only myself.

<H2>Community Column and Ad Copy</H2>
<P><EM>Community columns have a slightly different purpose and style than news releases like the one
on page 9. The columns are more "feature news" than "hard news" stories. They are ideally suited
for publication in a community newspaper, newsletters or such publications as politicians'
householders. Use the information for any letters you might write, including letters to the editor
of local newspapers. 
<BR>
<P>Personalize and retype the column shown here on your practice letterhead. Send it to   the editor
of the local paper and ask him or her to run it as  a column before or during Pharmacy Awareness
Week.  
<BR>
<P>Take the opportunity to offer to write a regular column on a variety of health care topics!</EM><BR>

<H3>Pharmacists Highlight "Full Scope" Services during Awareness Week</H3>

<P>Pharmacists across Canada are gearing up for their annual national public awareness campaign
called Pharmacy Awareness Week. From November 4-10, pharmacists from coast to coast will
organize and participate in activities aimed at drawing attention to their important, but often
overlooked, role as the most accessible health care provider and drug therapy expert.<BR>
<BR>
<P>The theme of this year's campaign is Shared Care:  You and Your pharmacist. Pharmacists are
developing activities that demonstrate the scope of services they provide to help improve the
health of their patients. <BR>
<BR>
<P>Although everyone uses the services of pharmacists at some time, many people do not  know
how to gain maximum value and benefit from them. Instead, people often take unnecessary risks
with their health by not ensuring that they have answers to all their medication questions.
Pharmacists are there to help, but patients sometimes have to be reminded that good health is a
shared responsibility. <BR>
<BR>
<P>Each year an estimated 12,500 lives and 2 million work days are lost in Canada because people
do not take their medications properly.  A recent review estimated that approximately 50% of
people do not take their prescription medications exactly as prescribed, at a cost to Canada's
health care system of $7 to $9 billion per year in direct and indirect costs.  It has also been
estimated that each year, drug noncompliance is the cause of 10% of all hospital admissions, up
to 25% of hospital admissions for the elderly and 23% of all nursing home admissions. <BR>
<BR>
<P>In partnership with pharmacists, patients can learn to maximize the benefits of their prescription
and nonprescription drugs. Recent research has estimated that Canadian pharmacists'
interventions save the Canadian health care system close to $400 million, or $66,000 per
pharmacy per year. We can do even more if we work together.<BR>
<BR>
<P>In addition to enhancing their patients' good health and vitality,  interventions by pharmacists
reduce the strain on our overburdened health care system. Increasing drug expenditures are a
Canada-wide problem. Often, they are associated with patients not taking their medication
properly or not finishing prescriptions once they start to feel better. Controlling drug
expenditures is a shared responsibility. If we all use our medications properly and safely, we can
be part of the solution instead of part of the problem.    <BR>
<BR>
<P><B>Pharmacy Awareness Week 1996</B> is sponsored by the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association, the
Canadian Society of Hospital Pharmacists, the Canadian Association of Pharmacy Students and
Interns, and your local pharmacy.<BR>

<H3>Can I keep my Canadian driver's licence? If I do will this affect my non-residency?</H3>
<P></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>
That retaining a Canadian driver's licence is viewed by Revenue Canada as a minor residential tie - 
one that is not significant enough (in the absence of other ties) to make you a resident of Canada? However, issuing licenses is a provincial 
responsibility and provincial rules on keeping a driver's license while living outside Canada vary widely.

<P>
Canadians Resident Abroad surveyed all twelve provincial and territorial licensing authorities to ascertain whether an individual
living outside of each jurisdiction could hold a valid driver's license.
<P>
To cite an example of what we found, Ontario law seems very liberal in this area. Ontario specifically permits a non-resident to renew his or her license using an Ontario 
address of a relative or friend. Ontario driver's permits are renewed once every five years and a new photograph is generally required at each renewal. Licensees living outside Ontario may renew 
once by mail without a photograph - a letter of explanation is required. For subsequent renewals, an official photograph will be required but a "contact" address can still be used.
<P>
While the B.C. authorities gave less detailed information, they referred to the possibility of
obtaining a "valid without photo" license if a person were living overseas "but really still a B.C. resident". P.E.I. responded that "a former resident" could renew a lciense
using a "contact" address.
<P>
Ont the other hand, jurisdictions such as Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec, and the Yukon replied to our questionnaire stating that driver's licenses were renewable by residents only.
<P>
For the complete results of our survey, plus addresses and telephone numbers for all provincial and territorial driver's license authorities, contact us at <A HREF="mailto:cra-hq@cdnsresabroad.com">Canadians Resident Abroad.</A>

Are you me?

"I didn't do it" I yell out;
The belt is hard and coarse.
"I didn't do it" reverberates down the hall;
The marks that give me sores are transient.
In some week they will fade;
The marks that etch my mind will linger with me as long as I live.

"I didn't do it" I speak out;
I get out of my car.
"I didn't do it" rattles down the halls;
I once again try to sneak into class unnoticed.
My teacher harps at me and tells me I am (the woman made me be THIS) late for the seventh time.
Again I am in trouble with my teacher.

"I didn't do it" I cry to the teacher;
She doesn't understand.
"I didn't do it" I say over and over during class;
The teacher gets impatient and sends me to the office (how blind they are).
They see me cry and they call my mommy;
I bet that when she comes they'll tell her I'm a bad little (thirty and now I hit my) girly.

"I didn't do it" I whimper as I get in the car;
A big spoon sits on the (what did mommy call it?) dashboard.
"I didn't do it" comes rushing out;
She picks up the spoon and (w)h(aps)its my face with (it hurts mommy) it.
I wonder what they do to people like (me) mommy;
What do they do to people like (hate) me who make their mommies hit them?

"I didn't do it" I tell my mommy;
How come (everyone) no one believes (mommy) me?
"I didn't do it" I expel forth;
Mommy hears me and hits my cheek very hard with a (cookie) shiny see-through jar.
It has cookies in (mommy can I have just one?) it;
Mommy says shut up and (mommy stop) hurt(ing)s me.

"I didn't do it" I sniffle;
Little red drops of (tell me even now that if I tell monsters will come and get) blood shoot out when I talk.
"I didn't do it" I try to tell my friends;
They just ignore me when I hurt and I tell them about monsters coming if I tell.
They must be scared of (what could happen to them) monsters;
Maybe theyve seen the monsters and thats why theyre scared of (mommy) monsters.

"I didn't do it" I tell that (police people are in blue suits mommy?) nice police man (never talk to them honey);
I get scared of why I am not supposed to talk to him (they shoot people and can kill you honey).
"I didn't do it" I say as I run away from the police man;
He talks into a little box (little girl three feet two hair red shoulder length green eyes blue dress with flowers).
I don't know why he is telling this box what I look like;
Maybe it's a talkie-walkier (they're funny things heeheehee).

"I didn't do it" I shout to mommy;
She keeps beating me with that (big shiny buckle on it) leather belt.
"I didn't do it" I yell to mommy;
(Knock Knock Knock) the door goes (only two knocks in a knock-knock joke person at the door).
I am scared and then mommy says don't (tell them anything and I will kill you) talk to them.
The police people come and take mommy away and I am scared.

"I didn't do it" I tell the man in the blue (police man) suit;
He says he knows and he will help me if he can.
"I didn't do it" I tell granddaddy and he says he understands;
Then they look shocked (what is it officer?) and sad.
Mommy comes out (look at those neat bars mommy why were you on the inside mommy?) of the cell;
The police tell me my mother isn't cruel and evil enough to lock her up for good.

I didnt do it I yell at my mommy when we get home;
She says (I'll kill you I will I will I will they are bad I told you not to tell them) she doesn't care.
"I didn't do it" I say but (they kill little girls but now I will) she wants to hurt (kill) me (you) really bad;
(I will) why do you want to hurt (kill) me mommy (you I will I will I will)?
Mommy gets out a (what's that mommy with the hole in that long barrel?) weird thingy like a banana;
NO MOMMY DON'T MOMMY DON'T I DIDN'T MEAN TO TELL MOMMY STOP I DIDN'T DO IT!


									BANG.




									MOMMY?

									Am I you?

in the kitchen, an older woman with more blonde than gray hair whistles

the ending of Miss Saigon,

the CD spinning in its player while in the den two younger women share
Secret laughter drifting over the white soapstone-like Horse on

the checkerboarded table.

I sit, wondering if I am in her thoughts for a fleeting moment,
then realize:
My love is hers, and hers is mine but
I am not much of her life separated as I am from her friends.

The large, brown dog at my feet chews at imaginary flea bites and
gulps for Air.

jealousy of the Closeness of friends.
the impatient yearning for more of a Bond that must grow slowly.
that has grown slowly.

More.  I am impatient.
Less.  Love grows at its own pace.

I can wait.  I will wait.

Seeing her,

He doesn't know to fight it;
He beats her for the <em>n<sup>th</sup></em> time.

<pre>

Once a man,
He now cowers in a corner as he watches his mother breathe her last before him
Oblivious to all less the memory:

An INTERRUPTed spEEch:
"But sir, does not the ocean need a bath?
"Does not the ground need a broom?
"Does not the air need a filter?"
<em>"You sister-
"You who's head seems fastened to thy body facing all that is rear,
"Trying to save the world indeed!"</em>
"In deed is what I say!
"In deed is what I do!"

And thus he cowers
Waits
Hopes

The seconds can redeem
His damning grin still mocks;

His crowd does now take offense,
Does not clap,
Does not cheer

Their absence mocks him back.
<em>"Perhaps I should learn to do the same"</em> he thinks;
Mother coughs again and slips further away.

The dark!
We are afraid,
But what can we do?
We are no longer

Here with our friends,
We have a life,
A hope,
A chance,
But what will happen

To us,
This is just a waste of lives.
This thing they do,
Cutting backs and cutting legs,
All for

Fur is their fancy,
And we don't understand why.
We try to run but they trap us in

Sharp metal jaws placed around our lairs tear us apart,
Limb from limb,
But there isn't a soul here who cares

About us.
About our young.
About our ancestors.

There is a pinpoint,
A speck of white in the distance-
Light at last!
No land here is safe

Even though we hunt with care,
Not drawing attention to ourselves,
Our spots are stolen from us.
What they have in mind are such:

Unimaginable thoughts go through their minds-
We've never wanted to kill these creatures before,
But what options have we?
What choice

Do they give us food?
Do they save us from disease?
Do they provide a den for us?
They show our young the way to keep up the packs

To hunt us down,
Many trick they do incorporate.
Our favorite is the duck call for our neighbors to the north.
Their instruments sound our with clarity

Of crackling fire the bush sounds;
The darkness seems more dense than ever,
Even though we can see further than before

We can't do anything as we are pushed from our homes.
Becoming fodder for the creatures who hunt us,
Our hair is ripped from our bodies as they destroy

OUR bodies
OUR lives
OUR homes
OURS OURS OURS

The light fades as our eyes melt
The sound dissipates as our ears rot
The feeling goes as our bodies cook

OUR bodies lives homes they're
				ours?

Dropping,
The sky lights up above them-
Fireworks for the foolhardy.
It's raining:
Explosions rock the landscape,
Mud and debris 
Fall on them 
A booming noise,
Carpet bombing  "Get DOWN!"
Medic!-Morphine!
But the cry does not get beyond the dead man's mouth:
A phantom calling for a man who cannot hear him 
The only soldier dead,
A man: No
	Legs
	Arms
	Chest
	Heart
	life

<pre>fingers tentative
outstretched hands afraid to touch
a gentle caress of the cheek
skin brushing gently against skin

he feels no longer the need to be alone
and yet
he feels no longer the need to be together

is this what it means to be content
to be angry at the world
longing for revenge for some
past misdeed long forgotten

or is it more immediate
some discontent at feeling
more than he wanted
but less than he needed
touching a part of him that
should not have been opened
and then shut as the contents
get their first taste of freedom

there is no ending except to
hunt the past down and ask others
to forget   to be angry   to be hurt

"it isnt good <em>enough</em>"
"you arent good <em>enough</em>"
who tells him this
others or himself
many times so many times so
he cannot remember when he starts

striving to become something he isnt
he finally accepts his demon form
welcomes his other half
lets it replace him for he is not himself

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>My style is a mix of Funk/Metal/Blues. I like grooves
and hooks. My music makes you want to band your head (or have sex.) I have
currently over 90 minutes of demos I have written myself plus songs I have
written with other people. We are recording in the studio. We have written
many songs which needs to be copy righted. What does the future hold? An
album! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Gary Evans, songwriter &amp; drummer, is my associate
in writing. We write well together and have written many songs together.
Currently, we are recording a new batch of songs. Gary constantly amazes
me with his talent and unique style of writing. He can hear things that
I can not and brings his own vision in to the music.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I will admit the fact that I do believe in God and have
always believed. As a child I could see things in a way that no one else
could. Which deity do I follow? My parents are Baptists (though my mother
was raised Church of God but we forgave her), raised my brother and I as
Baptists. There was a point in my life where I had to dismiss everything
I have been told and started from scratch by taking everything that I knew
to be true and sifted what I didn't know through that. What I believe is
so much different from what I has been led to believe.</FONT></P>

<P>
If you have a function that off-the-shelf software cannot perform, CDP can create a product that will.  We listen carefully to your objectives and work closely with you to produce an application that not only satisfies your initial design but that also leaves plenty of room for further customization and expansion.
<P>
Consider a recent project started by a CDP client.  The firm purchased a database of the country's top businesses, and the client's marketing and sales group needed a search engine for it.  CDP designed the engine, providing our client with the ability to identify companies by business segment and location.  The customized software also supplied client contact management, activity scheduling and competitor information.
<P>
That's typical of business today: incredibly smart people who recognize the advantages computers provide but are restricted by the limitations of general purpose, off-the-shelf software.
<P>
CDP uses the latest in 4th Generation programming languages and database packages to develop custom software that helps your organization meet its business goals and improve its competitive position.  And through CDP, developing custom software is an affordable option.

<FONT SIZE=3><B>
<P>
Not only can CDP install and service any hardware and software product you have in mind, we can help you acquire the specific computing power your operation needs by listening to your objectives.  That includes setting up networks that do what you want them to.
<P>
A company in a western state contracted us when its network reached its limits and support was difficult to find.  CDP not only helped the company purchase hardware and software, we also networked these products and coordinated the selection of local individuals to provide continued support.  When the company needs long-distance help, CDP analysts are able to dial into the client's system and make necessary adjustments quickly, seamlessly.  Literally, we're a telephone call away.  
<P>
When we begin a relationship, it's usually a long term one.

<P>
If your computer is down, and you don't know why, CDP is a full service support provider.  We are very familiar with just about every platform there is--DOS, Macintosh, mainframes and mini computers.
<P>
Even if your organization has a combination of platforms, we can provide integration solutions that allow them to communicate, making you more productive without having to start from scratch.

<P>The ubiquitous personal computer touches on every imaginable aspect of daily
life. Since the opening paragraph of this month's <B><I>President's Column</I></B>
relates to my March <A HREF="../9603/online.html"><B><I>Online Curmudgeon</I></B></A> column, I feel some
comments may be in order.</P>  
<H2><A NAME="1">An Anecdote</A></H2>
<P>A few decades ago, in a distant state, a motorist was stopped by a police
officer. A radio license check, using a newfangled computer system, indicated
that the tag number matched a list of stolen vehicles, and moments later the
motorist was dead, shot in his own car by the police officer.</P>
<P>It has been suggested that computer publications should never question what
the government does. The police carry guns. They sometimes shoot people.
Sometimes innocent citizens get killed. But never question what the government does.</P>
<P>As a young computer programmer, I learned from this incident in a
professional computer journal. No doubt others also learned a lesson here--one
we'll never forget--one we'll strive to apply for the rest of our careers. Let
me expand a little on this story.</P>
<P>Before the computer was installed, vehicle license checks took much longer,
and were processed by a clerk who pulled up and skimmed the file. The clerk
would have realized that a five-year old stolen-vehicle-report could not apply
to a year-old car. Yet the computer system had not been programmed to care.
Further, since that state reassigned numbers regularly, the clerk would have
learned from experience to put older records in the proper perspective. Yet the
computer system had not been programmed to know that, nor to learn from experience.</P>
<P>Before the computer was installed, the dispatcher would get the information,
passing along what was important first. The computer didn't know what was
important, so it couldn't do so.</P>
<P>The police officer knew from experience that quick action is important in
sensitive situations. He often had to rely on incomplete information. A later
part of the radio report, which the officer never heard, would have cleared up
the misunderstanding.</P>
<P>Was the police officer evil? Certainly not--he had an outstanding record.
Acting as best he knew.</P>
<P>Was the motorist evil? Certainly not--he had a clean driving record, and
respected in his community. Nor was the wallet he was reaching for a threat to
the police officer or anybody else.</P>
<P>Was the computer system evil? Were its designers? Hardly. Their goal was to
provide more information to the police officer. With 20-20 hindsight, they'd
provided too much information. Information which was understood in a different context than intended.</P>
<P>We can't change the tragedy. The innocent man was dead. His family and
friends, the officer who fired the shot, their lives would never be the same.</P>
<P>We can learn from the tragedy. I certainly did, and surely I'm not alone
here. Human factors are vital in system design. Not always life threatening, but
certainly important. And rarely in predictable ways.</P>  

<H2><A NAME="2">Diversity</A></H2>
<P>Our goal is for <B><I>Hard-Copy</I></B> to have at least one article of
interest and of value to each member in each issue. Our members have a wide
variety of interests, experiences, and skills. Often we succeed. Sometimes we
don't. [<I>Maybe, with your articles, too...hint]</I></P>
<P>We strive to provide a variety of articles each month. We do this by
favoring relatively short articles, just a few pages in length. We'll split an
article into several installments, rather than narrow our focus to just a few
articles in an issue.</P>
<P>We've several regular contributors to <B><I>Hard-Copy</I></B>, and quite a
few who write occasionally. We expect of them a degree of professional and
editorial quality. We've rarely been disappointed--often very pleased.</P>
<P>I'm pleased when my colums provoke thought and debate. Social issues provide
a context, within which to better discuss complex issues. &quot;Politics&quot;
is life. Not just what differs from one's personal views.</P>
<P>We've been careful to avoid a &quot;party line.&quot; My signed articles
certainly reflect my personal and professional views. Often in the same issue
you'll find articles by others with quite differing views. This is hardly by
chance. Articles from members with differing views promote the interaction which
is our very mission. This is something we strive for, are happy with, and want more often.</P>
<P>It has never been the goal of <B><I>Hard-Copy</I></B> to limit articles to
only those which match the technical or political views of the <B><I>Hard-Copy</I></B>
Editors. Nor of any Officer of the Society.</P>

<TABLE BORDER=5 CELLPADDING=10><TR><TD>
<H2><A NAME="0">CCS Mission Statement</A></H2>
<P><I>The <B>Chicago Computer Society</B></I> is a non-profit organization
providing educational and informational opportunities for its members. Through
interaction with each other and with vendors, members expand their knowledge,
understanding, and productive use of personal computer software and hardware.</P>
<P>The Society receives its vitality from members volunteering their time and
talents to create services for fellow members. In meetings and events held
throughout Chicagoland, our members contribute these services in turn to the community.</P>

<font size=+2>Words sound familiar? </font>Do you have problems so many of us experience in developing and selling user software:
<P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>Have you put off developing user manuals for lack of time or because you don't have the trained staff to write it?
<P>
<LI>Do you have trouble selling your product since you have poor user manuals, or none at all?  Could you improve sales by having quality user manuals for your quality software?
<P>
<LI>Do your present user manuals project the kind of image that you want for your company?  Are they user friendly?  Professional looking?
<P>
<LI>Do you need to train your staff to write manuals simply and easily to save time and money?
<P>
<LI>Does your staff <EM>hate </EM> writing?

<P>
<font size=+2>We've been there too. </font>And we like to share with you the tools we've developed to get us out of the rut:
<P>
<UL TYPE=disc>
<LI>A cadre of documentation specialists with years of experience in writing user manuals and other technical and professional documents.
<P>
<LI>A plan for researching and writing user manuals that we have field tested in documenting our own software.  This plan includes a set of templates that save time and reduce production costs.
<P>
<LI>Training experts who can teach your staff what they need: from using correct grammar and syntax, to organizing and drafting user-friendly instructions.  Our staff has instructed engineers, programmers, managers, and even other writers to document quickly and simply and to enjoy the process.
<P>
<LI>Documentation tools that you can use to maintain and update user manuals after we're gone.  We'll even train your staff to use them.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<font size=+2>What does this mean to you? </font>User manuals that you can be proud of, that your customer can use, and that will save you time, money, and employee frustration!

<H2>Notes on <A HREF="warren03.htm#I122">Richard Furman</A></H2>
Richard Furman,  who succeeded [Oliver] Hart as pastor of FBC Charleston was born on October 9,  1755,  at Esopus pious Anglican family. In 1771,  Furman experienced a dramatic conversion under the preaching of Joseph Reese,  a zealous Separate Baptist,  who questioned Furman thoroughly in front of the entire church just before his baptism. Furman went through a period of deep study of Scripture and doctrine and long hours of prayer and meditation. He even stood as an exhorter in worship services in spite of ridicule and opposition from his teen-age peers. In 1773,  at eighteen,  Furman was licensed by the High Hills Church. This action put him in contact with a company of men who would greatly influence him. In that year he met Oliver Hart,  who was greatly impressed with the young preacher and from the beginning treated Furman as an equal. He also met John Gano,  a messenger that year from the Philadelphia Association to the Charleston Association. Furman enjoyed the "rigorous intellect,  the ready
eloquence scriptural knowledge,  evangelical simplicity,  and fervid devotion" of Gano. Gano wrote the circular letter for the Philadelphia Association in 1784 on "Effectual Calling" defining it as "an act of sovereign grace which flows from the everlasting love of God,  and is such an irresistible impression made by the Holy Spirit upon the human soul as to effect a blessed change." Gano defined the "called" as "such as God hath chosen and predestinated both to grace and glory,  elected and set apart in Christ,  as redeemed by his blood,  although by nature children of wrath even as others." That Gano's impact on Furman was substantial is seen by the tribute Furman paid to him at his death in 1806. As a minister of Christ,  he shone like a star of the first magnitude in the American churches and moved in a widely extended field of action....He was not deficient in doctrinal discussion,  or what rhetoricians call the demonstrative character of a discourse; but he excelled in the pathetic, --in pungent,
forcible addresses to the heart and conscience. The careless and irreverent were suddenly arrested,  and stood awed before him; and the insensible were made to feel,  while he asserted and maintained the honour of his God,  explained the meaning of the Divine law,  showing its purity and justice,  exposed the sinner's guilt proved him to be miserable ruined and inexcusable,  and called him to unfeigned,  immediate repentance...The doctrines he embraced were those which are contained in the Baptist Confession of Faith,  and are commonly styled Calvinistic. But he was of a liberal mind,  and esteemed pious men of every denomination. While he maintained,  with consistent firmness,  the doctrines which he believed to be the truths of God,  he was modest in the judgment which he formed of this own opinion,  and careful to avoid giving offence.... He was cordially esteemed and honoured by the wise and good of all denominations.[9] That description could very well be applied to Furman himself. Furman's sermons were
filled with doctrine,  though he was not doctrinaire. He was a strong Calvinist of the historic experiential kind. His love for gospel truth shone bright and pure; its beauty,  however,  did not consist of its abstract conformity to ideal categories or its internal consistency,  though he would defend both. Its beauty consisted of its enlightening and transforming impact on the heart,  under the Spirit's power,  so as to renew the image of God in fallen creatures,  recreating them in true righteousness and holiness. His sermon entitled "Conversion Essential to Salvation" demonstrates the beauty of applied Calvinism.[10] Though Furman understood the technical difference between conversion and regeneration as some theologians defined the terms,  his aim was not to present a "refined metaphysical discussion." He simply defined conversion as "a renovation of the soul by the spirit of God." This definition was predicated on the doctrines of man's depravity and God's holiness. It does not involve an extinction of
any of the natural faculties of the soul,  but these faculties all undergo a "great and evident change,  in a moral or spiritual sense." Something in the nature of regeneration is "mysterious and wonderful" and as inscrutable as the "operations and effects of the wind in the natural world." Its effects,  however,  will be "repentance toward God faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ; a hatred to sin,  and a love to holiness; supreme love to God,  and unfeigned benevolence to men including sincerity,  humility,  meekness accompanying graces,  which distinguish and adorn the "new man." We see in this construction that Furman expounds the normal Calvinistic ordo salutis. Regeneration,  or the new birth,  precedes by virtue of moral necessity the graces of repentance and faith. He goes on to say later "We have already seen,  that the renovation of a sinner is the work of God. A man cannot change his own heart: How then can he effect this necessary,  important change in the soul of another?"[11] From an article,  The
